                TopGit installation

Direct from source
------------------

Although TopGit is essentially a bunch of shell scripts (and their
accompanying documentation), it does require some preprocessing.

Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", and that will
install the tg program in your own ~/bin/ directory.  If you want to do a
global install, you can do

    make prefix=/usr install # as root

(or prefix=/usr/local, of course).  Just like any program suite that uses
$prefix, the built results have some paths encoded, which are derived from
$prefix, so "make; make prefix=/usr install" would not work.

The Makefile does not currently install the bash completion support in
contrib/tg-completion.bash. Instructions for installing that file are at the
top of that file.

To install the html version of the help you need rst2html and then use
"make html" followed by "make install-html".  The same use of prefix=
applies here as well.  Set RST2HTML to the location of the rst2html
executabile if it's not named "rst2html" or not located in $PATH.  Also
note that "make doc" and "make install-doc" will accomplish the same thing.

The standard DESTDIR variable is supported to install to an intermediate
location before moving to the final intended destination via some other means.

Alternatively, you can install using OS/distro-specific packages or similar
- which should also pull in git as a dependency if you are installing on
a machine which does not already have git installed.

Note that most such packages have not yet been updated to point to the new
TopGit repo on GitHub. Ones that have are listed below:

Linux

* Fedora/EPEL/QubesOS: yum install topgit
* Exherbo: cave resolve dev-scm/topgit -x
