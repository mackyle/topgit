=========================================
TopGit -- A different patch queue manager
=========================================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

TopGit aims to make handling of large amounts of interdependent topic
branches easier. In fact, it is designed especially for the case where
you maintain a queue of third-party patches on top of another (perhaps
Git-controlled) project and want to easily organize, maintain and submit
them -- TopGit achieves that by keeping a separate topic branch for each
patch and providing some tools to maintain the branches.

	:TECHNICAL_:	    How it works behind the scenes


REQUIREMENTS
------------

TopGit is a collection of POSIX shell scripts so a POSIX-compliant shell is
required along with some standard POSIX-compliant utilities (e.g. sed, awk,
cat, etc.).  Git version 1.8.5 or later is also required.

To use TopGit with linked working trees (the ``git worktree add`` command),
at least Git version 2.5.0 (obviously, since that's when the ``git worktree``
command first appeared) is needed in which case linked working trees are then
fully supported for use with TopGit.

The scripts need to be preprocessed and installed and currently the Makefile
that does this requires GNU make, but that's an install-time-only requirement.

It is possible, however, to use the DESTDIR functionality to install TopGit to
a staging area on one machine, archive that and then unarchive it on another
machine to perform an install (provided the build prefix and other options are
compatible with the final installed location).


INSTALLATION
------------

See the file ``INSTALL``.


GIT REPOSITORY
--------------

The TopGit git repository can be found at <http://repo.or.cz/topgit/pro>.


RATIONALE
---------

Why not use something like StGIT or Guilt or ``rebase -i`` for maintaining
your patch queue?  The advantage of these tools is their simplicity;
they work with patch *series* and defer to the reflog facility for
version control of patches (reordering of patches is not
version-controlled at all).  But there are several disadvantages -- for
one, these tools (especially StGIT) do not actually fit well with plain
Git at all: it is basically impossible to take advantage of the index
effectively when using StGIT.  But more importantly, these tools
horribly fail in the face of a distributed environment.

TopGit has been designed around three main tenets:

	(i) TopGit is as thin a layer on top of Git as possible.  You
	still maintain your index and commit using Git; TopGit will only
	automate a few indispensable tasks.

	(ii) TopGit is anxious about *keeping* your history.  It will
	never rewrite your history, and all metadata is also tracked
	by Git, smoothly and non-obnoxiously.  It is good to have a
	*single* point when the history is cleaned up, and that is at
	the point of inclusion in the upstream project; locally, you
	can see how your patch has evolved and easily return to older
	versions.

	(iii) TopGit is specifically designed to work in a
	distributed environment.  You can have several instances of
	TopGit-aware repositories and smoothly keep them all
	up-to-date and transfer your changes between them.

As mentioned above, the main intended use-case for TopGit is tracking
third-party patches, where each patch is effectively a single topic
branch.  In order to flexibly accommodate even complex scenarios when
you track many patches where many are independent but some depend on
others, TopGit ignores the ancient Quilt heritage of patch series and
instead allows the patches to freely form graphs (DAGs just like Git
history itself, only "one level higher").  For now, you have to manually
specify which patches the current one depends on, but TopGit might help
you with that in the future in a darcs-like fashion.

A glossary_ plug: The union (i.e. merge) of patch dependencies is called
a *base* of the patch (topic branch).

Of course, TopGit is perhaps not the right tool for you:

	(i) TopGit is not complicated, but StGIT et al. are somewhat
	simpler, conceptually.  If you just want to make a linear
	purely-local patch queue, deferring to StGIT instead might
	make more sense.

	(ii) When using TopGit, your history can get a little hairy
	over time, especially with all the merges rippling through.

CONVENTIONS
-----------

When using TopGit there are several common conventions used when working with
TopGit branches.  None of them are enforced, they are only suggestions.

There are three typical uses for a TopGit branch:

    1. [PATCH]
       Normal TopGit branches that represent a single patch.  These are known
       as "patch" TopGit branches.
    2. [BASE]
       Empty TopGit branches with no dependencies (an empty ``.topdeps`` file)
       that represent a base upon which other "normal" TopGit branches depend.
       These are known as "base" TopGit branches (not to be confused with
       the refs/top-bases/... refs).
    3. [STAGE]
       Empty TopGit branches that serve as a staging area to bring together
       several other TopGit branches into one place so they can be used/tested
       all together.  These are known as "stage" TopGit branches.

An "empty" TopGit branch is one that does not have any changes of its own --
it may still have dependencies though ("stage" branches do, "base" branches do
not).  The ``tg summary`` output shows empty branches with a ``0`` in the
listing.  Normal "patch" branches that have not been annihilated, "base" and
"stage" branches fall into this category.  (Annihilated branches are normally
omitted from the ``tg summary`` output but can be shown if given explicitly as
an argument to the ``tg summary`` command.  However, the message line will be
incorrect since an annihilated branch has no ``.topmsg`` file of its own.)

A "patch" branch name typically starts with ``t/`` whereas "base" and "stage"
branch names often do not.

A "base" branch is created by using the ``--no-deps`` option of ``tg create``
which will automatically suggest a "[BASE]" message prefix rather than
"[PATCH]".  A "stage" branch is created like a normal patch branch except that
the only changes that will ever be made to it are typically to add/remove
dependencies.  Its subject prefix must be manually changed to "[STAGE]" to
reflect its purpose.

Since both "base" and "stage" branches typically only have a use for the
"Subject:" ilne from their ``.topmsg`` file, they are quite easily created
using the ``--topmsg`` option of ``tg create``.

Use of "stage" and "base" branches is completely optional.  However, without
use of a "stage" branch it will be difficult to test multiple independent
patches together all at once.  A "base" branch is merely a convenience that
provides more explicit control over when a common base for a set of patches
gets updated as well as providing a branch that shows in ``tg summary`` output
and participates in ``tg remote --populate`` setup.

When using the ``tg tag`` command to create tags that record the current state
of one or more TopGit branches, the tags are often created with a name that
starts with ``t/``.

One last thing, you have enabled ``git rerere`` haven't you?


NO UNDO
-------

Beware, there is no "undo" after running a ``tg update``!

Well, that's not entirely correct.  Since ``tg update`` never discards commits
an "undo" operation is technically feasible provided the old values of all the
refs that were affected by the ``tg update`` operation can be determined and
then they are simply changed back to their previous values.

In practice though, it can be extremely tedious and error prone looking through
log information to try and determine what the correct previous values were.
Although, since TopGit tries to make sure reflogs are enabled for top-bases
refs, using Git's ``@{date}`` notation on all the refs dumped out by a
``tg tag --refs foo``, where "foo" is the branch that was updated whose update
needs to be undone, may work.

Alternatively, ``tg tag --stash`` can be used prior to the update and then
``tg revert`` used after the update to restore the previous state.  This
assumes, of course, that you remember to run ``tg tag --stash`` first.

The ``tg update`` command understands a ``--stash`` option that tells it to
automatically run ``tg tag --stash`` before it starts making changes (if
everything is up-to-date it won't run the stash command at all).

The ``--stash`` option is the default nowadays when running ``tg update``,
add the ``--no-stash`` option to turn it off.

There is a preference for this.  Setting the config value ``topgit.autostash``
to ``false`` will implicitly add the ``--no-stash`` option to any ``tg update``
command unless an explicit ``--stash`` option is given.

If you are likely to ever want to undo a ``tg update``, setting
``topgit.autostash`` to ``false`` is highly discouraged!

Note that the tags saved by ``tg tag --stash`` are stored in the
``refs/tgstash`` ref and its reflog.  Unfortunately, while Git is happy to
maintain the reflog (once it's been enabled which ``tg tag`` guarantees for
``refs/tgstash``), Git is unable to view an annotated/signed tag's reflog!
Instead Git dereferences the tag and shows the wrong thing.  Use the
``tg tag -g`` command to view the ``refs/tgstash`` reflog instead.


SEQUESTRATION
-------------

No, this is not a section about budget nonsense.  ;)

TopGit keeps its metadata in ``.topdeps`` and ``.topmsg`` files.  In an effort
to facilitate cherry-picking and other Git activities on the patch changes
themselves while ignoring the TopGit metadata, TopGit attempts to keep all
changes to ``.topdeps`` and ``.topmsg`` files limited to commits that do NOT
contain changes to any other files.

This is a departure from previous TopGit versions that made no such effort.

Primarily this affects ``tg create`` and ``tg import`` (which makes use of
``tg create``) as ``tg create`` will commit the initial versions of
``.topdeps`` and ``.topmsg`` for a new TopGit-controlled branch in their own
commit instead of mixing them in with changes to other files.

The ``pre-commit`` hook will also attempt to separate out any ``.topdeps`` and
``.topmsg`` changes from commits that include changes to other files.

It is possible to defeat these checks without much effort (``pre-commit`` hooks
can easily be bypassed, ``tg create`` has a ``--no-commit`` option, many Git
commands simply do not run the ``pre-commit`` hook, etc.).

If you really, really, really, really want to change the default back to the
old behavior of previous TopGit versions where no such sequestration took
place, then set the ``topgit.sequester`` config variable explicitly to the
value ``false``.  But this is not recommended.


AMENDING AND REBASING AND UPDATE-REF'ING
----------------------------------------

In a word, "don't".

It is okay to manually update a top-bases/... ref when a) it has no depedencies
(i.e. it was created with the ``tg create`` ``--no-deps`` option) and b) the
old top-bases/... ref value can be fast-forwarded to the new top-bases/...
value OR the new value contains ALL of the changes in the old value through
some other mechanism (perhaps they were cherry-picked or otherwise applied to
the new top-bases/... ref).  The same rules apply to non-TopGit-controlled
dependencies.

Ignoring this rule and proceeding anyway with a non-fast-forward update to a
top-bases/... ref will result in changes present in the new value being merged
into the branch (at ``tg update`` time) as expected (possibly with conflicts),
but any changes that were contained in the old version of the top-bases/... ref
which have been dropped (i.e. are NOT contained in the new version of the
top-bases/... ref) will continue to be present in the branch!  To get rid of
the dropped commits, one or more "revert" commits will have to be manually
applied to the tip of the new top-bases/... value (which will then be merged
into the branch at next ``tg update`` time).

The only time it's safe to amend, rebase, filter or otherwise rewrite commits
contained in a TopGit controlled branch or non-TopGit branch is when those
commits are NOT reachable via any other ref!

Furthermore, while it is safe to rewrite merge commits (provided they meet the
same conditions) the merge commits themselves and the branches they are merging
in must be preserved during the rewrite and that can be rather tricky to get
right so it's not recommended.

For example, if, while working on a TopGit-controlled branch ``foo``, a bad
typo is noticed, it's okay to ammend/rebase to fix that provided neither
``tg update`` nor ``tg create`` has already been used to cause some other ref
to be able to reach the commit with the typo.

If an amend or rerwite is done anyway even though the commit with the typo is
reachable from some other ref, the typo won't really be removed.  What will
happen instead is that the new version without the typo will ultimately be
merged into the other ref(s) (at ``tg update`` time) likely causing a conflict
that will have to be manually resolved and the commit with the typo will
continue to be reachable from those other refs!

Instead just make a new commit to fix the typo.  The end result will end up
being the same but without the merge conflicts.

See also the discussion in the `NO UNDO`_ section.


SPEED AND CACHING
-----------------

TopGit needs to check many things to determine whether a TopGit branch is
up-to-date or not.  This can involve a LOT of git commands for a complex
dependency tree.  In order to speed things up, TopGit keeps a cache of results
in a ``tg-cache`` subdirectory in the ``.git`` directory.

Results are tagged with the original hash values used to get that result so
that items which have not been changed return their results quickly and items
which have been changed compute their new result and cache it for future use.

The ``.git/tg-cache`` directory may be removed at any time and the cache will
simply be recreated in an on-demand fashion as needed, at some speed penalty,
until it's fully rebuilt.

To force the cache to be fully pre-loaded, run the ``tg summary`` command
without any arguments.  Otherwise, normal day-to-day TopGit operations should
keep it more-or-less up-to-date.

While each TopGit command is running, it uses a temporary subdirectory also
located in the ``.git`` directory.  These directories are named
``tg-tmp.XXXXXX`` where the ``XXXXXX`` part will be random letters and digits.

These temporary directories should always be removed automatically after each
TopGit command finishes running.  As long as you are not in a subshell as a
result of a TopGit command stopping and waiting for a manual merge resolution,
it's safe to remove any of these directories that may have somehow accidentally
been left behind as a result of some failure that occurred while running a
TopGit command (provided, of course, it's not actually being used by a TopGit
command currently running in another terminal window or by another user on the
same repository).

tg help
~~~~~~~
	Our sophisticated integrated help facility.  Mostly duplicates
	what is below::

	 # to list commands:
	 $ tg help
	 # to get help for a particular command:
	 $ tg help <command>
	 # to get help for a particular command in a browser window:
	 $ tg help -w <command>
	 # to get help on TopGit itself
	 $ tg help tg
	 # to get help on TopGit itself in a browser
	 $ tg help -w tg

tg status
~~~~~~~~~
	Our sophisticated status facility.  Similar to Git's status command
	but shows any in-progress update that's awaiting a merge resolution
	or any other on-going TopGit activity (such as a branch creation).

	With a single ``--verbose`` (or ``-v``) option include a short status
	display for any dirty (but not untracked) files.  This also causes all
	non file status lines to be prefixed with "## ".

	With two (or more) ``--verbose`` (or ``-v``) options, additionally
	show full symbolic ref names and unabbreviated hash values.

	With the ``--exit-code`` option the exit code will be non-zero if any
	TopGit or Git operation is currently in progress or the working
	tree is unclean.

tg create
~~~~~~~~~
	Create a new TopGit-controlled topic branch of the given name
	(required argument) and switch to it.  If no dependencies are
	specified (by extra arguments passed after the first one), the
	current branch is assumed to be the only dependency.

	By default ``tg create`` opens an editor on the new ``.topmsg`` file
	and then commits the new ``.topmsg`` and ``.topdeps`` files
	automatically with a suitable default commit message.

	The commit message can be changed with the ``-m`` (or ``--message``) or
	``-F`` (or ``--file``) option.  The automatic commit can be suppressed
	by using the ``--no-ccmmit`` option.  Running the editor on the new
	``.topmsg`` file can be suppressed by using ``-n`` (or ``--no-edit``)
	(which also suppresses the automatic commit) or by providing an
	explicit value for the new ``.topmsg`` file using the ``--topmsg`` or
	``--topmsg-file`` option.  In any case the ``.topmsg`` content will be
	automatically reformated to have a ``Subject:`` header line if needed.

	If more than one dependency is listed, the automatic commit will not
	take place until AFTER all the listed dependencies have been merged
	into a base commit which will require some manual merge resolutions if
	conflicts occur during the merge operations.

	Previous versions of TopGit behaved as though the ``--no-edit`` option
	was always given on the command line.

	The default behavior has been changed to promote a separation between
	commits that modify ``.topmsg`` and/or ``.topdeps`` and commits that
	modify other files.  This facilitates cleaner cherry picking and other
	patch maintenance activities.

	You should edit the patch description (contained in the ``.topmsg``
	file) as appropriate.  It will already contain some prefilled bits.
	You can set the ``topgit.to``, ``topgit.cc`` and ``topgit.bcc``
	git configuration variables (see ``man git-config``) in order to
	have ``tg create`` add these headers with the given default values
	to ``.topmsg`` before invoking the editor.

	The main task of ``tg create`` is to set up the topic branch base
	from the dependencies.  This may fail due to merge conflicts if more
	than one dependency is given.	In that case, after you commit the
	conflict resolution, you should call ``tg update --continue`` to
	finish merging the dependencies into the new topic branch base.

	With the ``--no-deps`` option at most one dependency may be listed
	which may be any valid committish (instead of just refs/heads/...) and
	the newly created TopGit-controlled branch will have an empty
	``.topdeps`` file.  This may be desirable in order to create a TopGit-
	controlled branch that has no changes of its own and serves merely to
	mark the common dependency that all other TopGit-controlled branches
	in some set of TopGit-controlled branches depend on.  A plain,
	non-TopGit-controlled branch can be used for the same purpose, but the
	advantage of a TopGit-controlled branch with no dependencies is that it
	will be pushed with ``tg push``, it will show up in the ``tg summary``
	and ``tg info`` output with the subject from its ``.topmsg`` file
	thereby documenting what it's for and finally it can be set up with
	``tg create -r`` and/or ``tg remote --populate`` to facilitate sharing.

	For example, ``tg create --no-deps release v2.1`` will create a TopGit-
	controlled ``release`` branch based off the ``v2.1`` tag that can then
	be used as a base for creation of other TopGit-controlled branches.
	Then when the time comes to move the base for an entire set of changes
	up to ``v2.2`` the command ``git update-ref top-bases/release v2.2^0``
	can be used followed by ``tg update --all``.  Note that it's only safe
	to update ``top-bases/release`` directly in this manner because a) it
	has no depedencies since it was created with the ``--no-deps`` option
	and b) the old ``top-bases/release`` value can be fast-forwarded to the
	new ``top-bases/release`` value.

	Using ``--no-deps`` it's also possible to use ``tg create`` on an
	unborn branch (omit the dependency name or specify ``HEAD``).  The
	unborn branch itself can be made into the new TopGit branch (rather
	than being born empty and then having the new TopGit branch based off
	that) by specifying ``HEAD`` as the new branch's name (which is
	probably what you normally want to do in this case anyway so you can
	just run ``tg create --no-deps HEAD`` to accomplish that).

	In an alternative use case, if ``-r <branch>`` is given instead of a
	dependency list, the topic branch is created based on the given
	remote branch.  With just ``-r`` the remote branch name is assumed
	to be the same as the local topic branch being created.  Since no
	new commits are created in this mode (only two refs will be updated)
	the editor will never be run for this use case.  Note that no other
	options may be combined with ``-r``.

	The ``--quiet`` (or ``-q``) option suppresses most informational
	messages.

tg delete
~~~~~~~~~
	Remove a TopGit-controlled topic branch of the given name
	(required argument). Normally, this command will remove only an
	empty branch (base == head) without dependendents; use ``-f`` to
	remove a non-empty branch or a branch that is depended upon by
	another branch.

	The ``-f`` option is also useful to force removal of a branch's
	base, if you used ``git branch -D B`` to remove branch B, and then
	certain TopGit commands complain, because the base of branch B
	is still there.

	Normally ``tg delete`` will refuse to delete the current branch.
	However, giving ``-f`` twice (or more) will force it to do so but it
	will first detach your HEAD.

	IMPORTANT: Currently, this command will *NOT* remove the branch
	from the dependency list in other branches. You need to take
	care of this *manually*.  This is even more complicated in
	combination with ``-f`` -- in that case, you need to manually
	unmerge the removed branch's changes from the branches depending
	on it.

	See also ``tg annihilate``.

	| TODO: ``-a`` to delete all empty branches, depfix, revert

tg annihilate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Make a commit on the current TopGit-controlled topic branch
	that makes it equal to its base, including the presence or
	absence of .topmsg and .topdeps.  Annihilated branches are not
	displayed by ``tg summary``, so they effectively get out of your
	way.  However, the branch still exists, and ``tg push`` will
	push it (except if given the ``-a`` option).  This way, you can
	communicate that the branch is no longer wanted.

	When annihilating a branch that has dependents (i.e. branches
	that depend on it), those dependents have the dependencies of
	the branch being annihilated added to them if they do not already
	have them as dependencies.  Essentially the DAG is repaired to
	skip over the annihilated branch.

	Normally, this command will remove only an empty branch
	(base == head, except for changes to the .top* files); use
	``-f`` to annihilate a non-empty branch.

	After completing the annihilation itself, normally ``tg update``
	is run on any modified dependents.  Use the ``--no-update`` option
	to suppress running ``tg update``.

tg depend
~~~~~~~~~
	Change the dependencies of a TopGit-controlled topic branch.
	This should have several subcommands, but only ``add`` is
	supported right now.

	The ``add`` subcommand takes an argument naming a topic branch to
	be added, adds it to ``.topdeps``, performs a commit and then
	updates your topic branch accordingly.  If you want to do other
	things related to the dependency addition, like adjusting
	``.topmsg``, use the option ``--no-commit``.  Adding the
	``--no-update`` (or ``--no-commit``) option will suppress the
	``tg update`` normally performed after committing the change.

	It is safe to run ``tg depend add`` in a dirty worktree, but the
	normally performed ``tg update`` will be suppressed in that case
	(even if neither ``--no-update`` nor ``--no-commit`` is given).

	You have enabled ``git rerere`` haven't you?

	| TODO: Subcommand for removing dependencies, obviously

tg files
~~~~~~~~
	List files changed by the current or specified topic branch.

	Options:
	  -i		list files based on index instead of branch
	  -w		list files based on working tree instead of branch

tg info
~~~~~~~
	Show summary information about the current or specified topic
	branch.

	Numbers in parenthesis after a branch name such as "(11/3 commits)"
	indicate how many commits on the branch (11) and how many of those
	are non-merge commits (3).

	Alternatively, if ``--heads`` is used then which of the independent
	TopGit branch heads (as output by ``tg summary --topgit-heads``)
	logically contains the specified commit (which may be any committish --
	defaults to ``HEAD`` if not given).  Zero or more results will be
	output.  Note that "logically" means with regard to the TopGit
	dependency relationships as established by the ``.topdeps`` file(s).
	It's the answer that would be given when all the TopGit branches are
	up-to-date (even though they need not be to use this option) and the
	``git branch --contains`` command is run and the output then filtered
	to only those branches that appear in ``tg summary --topgit-heads``.
	This computation may require several seconds on complex repositories.

	If ``--leaves`` is used then the unique list of leaves of the current
	or specified topic branch is shown as one fully-qualified ref per line.
	Duplicates are suppressed and a tag name will be used when appropriate.
	A "leaf" is any dependency that is either not a TopGit branch or is
	the base of a non-annihilated TopGit branch with no non-annihilated
	dependencies.

	A linearized patch series can only be automatically created for a
	TopGit topic branch (including its recursive dependencies) when exactly
	one line is output by ``tg info --leaves <topic-branch>``.

tg patch
~~~~~~~~
	Generate a patch from the current or specified topic branch.
	This means that the diff between the topic branch base and head
	(latest commit) is shown, appended to the description found in
	the ``.topmsg`` file.

	The patch is simply dumped to stdout.  In the future, ``tg patch``
	will be able to automatically send the patches by mail or save
	them to files. (TODO)

	Options:
	  -i		base patch generation on index instead of branch
	  -w		base patch generation on working tree instead of branch
	  --binary	pass --binary to ``git diff-tree`` to enable generation
	  		of binary patches
	  --diff-opt	options after the branch name (and an optional ``--``)
	  		are passed directly to ``git diff-tree``

	In order to pass a sole explicit ``-w`` through to ``git diff-tree`` it
	must be separated from the ``tg`` options by an explicit ``--``.
	Or it can be spelled as ``--ignore-all-space`` to distinguuish it from
	``tg``'s ``-w`` option.

	If additional non-``tg`` options are passed through to
	``git diff-tree`` (other than ``--binary`` which is fully supported)
	the resulting ``tg patch`` output may not be appliable.

tg mail
~~~~~~~
	Send a patch from the current or specified topic branch as
	email(s).

	Takes the patch given on the command line and emails it out.
	Destination addresses such as To, Cc and Bcc are taken from the
	patch header.

	Since it actually boils down to ``git send-email``, please refer
	to the documentation for that for details on how to setup email
	for git.  You can pass arbitrary options to this command through
	the ``-s`` parameter, but you must double-quote everything.  The
	``-r`` parameter with a msgid can be used to generate in-reply-to
	and reference headers to an earlier mail.

	WARNING: be careful when using this command.  It easily sends
	out several mails.  You might want to run::

		git config sendemail.confirm always

	to let ``git send-email`` ask for confirmation before sending any
	mail.

	Options:
	  -i		base patch generation on index instead of branch
	  -w		base patch generation on working tree instead of branch

	| TODO: ``tg mail patchfile`` to mail an already exported patch
	| TODO: mailing patch series
	| TODO: specifying additional options and addresses on command line

tg remote
~~~~~~~~~
	Register the given remote as TopGit-controlled. This will create
	the namespace for the remote branch bases and teach ``git fetch``
	to operate on them. However, from TopGit 0.8 onwards you need to
	use ``tg push``, or ``git push --mirror``, for pushing
	TopGit-controlled branches.

	``tg remote`` takes an optional remote name argument, and an
	optional ``--populate`` switch.  Use ``--populate`` for your
	origin-style remotes: it will seed the local topic branch system
	based on the remote topic branches.  ``--populate`` will also make
	``tg remote`` automatically fetch the remote, and ``tg update`` look
	at branches of this remote for updates by default.

	Using ``--populate`` with a remote name causes the ``topgit.remote``
	git configuration variable to be set to the given remote name.

tg summary
~~~~~~~~~~
	Show overview of all TopGit-tracked topic branches and their
	up-to-date status.  With a branch name limit output to that branch.
	Using ``--deps-only`` or ``--rdeps`` changes the default from all
	branches to just the current ``HEAD`` branch but using ``--all`` as
	the branch name will show results for all branches instead of ``HEAD``.

		``>``
			marks the current topic branch

		``0``
			indicates that it introduces no changes of its own

		``l``/``r``
			indicates respectively whether it is local-only
			or has a remote mate

		``L``/``R``
			indicates respectively if it is ahead or out-of-date
			with respect to its remote mate

		``D``
			indicates that it is out-of-date with respect to its
			dependencies

		``!``
			indicates that it has missing dependencies [even if
			they are recursive ones]

		``B``
			indicates that it is out-of-date with respect to
			its base

	This can take a longish time to accurately determine all the
	relevant information about each branch; you can pass ``-t`` (or ``-l``
	or ``--list``) to get just a terse list of topic branch names quickly.

	Passing ``--heads`` shows independent topic branch names and when
	combined with ``--rdeps`` behaves as though ``--rdeps`` were run with
	the output of ``--heads``.

	The ``--heads-independent`` option works just like ``--heads`` except
	that it computes the heads using ``git merge-base --independent``
	rather than examining the TopGit ``.topdeps`` relationships.  If the
	TopGit branches are all up-to-date (as shown in ``tg summary``) then
	both ``--heads`` and ``--heads-independent`` should compute the same
	list of heads (unless some overlapping TopGit branches have been
	manually created).  If not all the TopGit branches are up-to-date then
	the ``--heads-independent`` results may have extra items in it, but
	occasionally that's what's needed; usually it's the wrong answer.
	(Note that ``--topgit-heads`` is accepted as an alias for ``--heads``
	as well.)

	Using ``--heads-only`` behaves as though the output of ``--heads`` was
	passed as the list of branches along with ``--without-deps``.

	Alternatively, you can pass ``--graphviz`` to get a dot-suitable output
	for drawing a dependency graph between the topic branches.

	You can also use the ``--sort`` option to sort the branches using
	a topological sort.  This is especially useful if each
	TopGit-tracked topic branch depends on a single parent branch,
	since it will then print the branches in the dependency order.
	In more complex scenarios, a text graph view would be much more
	useful, but that has not yet been implemented.

	The ``--deps`` option outputs dependency information between
	branches in a machine-readable format.  Feed this to ``tsort`` to
	get the output from --sort.

	The ``--deps-only`` option outputs a sorted list of the unique branch
	names given on the command line plus all of their recursive
	dependencies (subject to ``--exclude`` of course).  When
	``--deps-only`` is given the default is to just display information for
	``HEAD``, but that can be changed by using ``--all`` as the branch
	name.  Each branch name will appear only once in the output no matter
	how many times it's visited while tracing the dependency graph or how
	many branch names are given on the command line to process.

	The ``--rdeps`` option outputs dependency information in an indented
	text format that clearly shows all the dependencies and their
	relationships to one another.  When ``--rdeps`` is given the default is
	to just display information for ``HEAD``, but that can be changed by
	using ``--all`` as the branch name or by adding the ``--heads`` option.
	Note that ``tg summary --rdeps --heads`` can be particularly helpful in
	seeing all the TopGit-controlled branches in the repository and	their
	relationships to one another.

	Adding ``--with-deps`` replaces the given list of branches (which will
	default to ``HEAD`` if none are given) with the result of running
	``tg summary --deps-only --tgish`` on the list of branches.  This can
	be helpful in limiting ``tg summary`` output to only the list of given
	branches and their dependencies when many TopGit-controlled branches
	are present in the repository.  When it would be allowed,
	``--with-deps`` is now the default.  Use ``--without-deps`` to switch
	back to the old behavior.

	With ``--exclude branch``, branch can be excluded from the output
	meaning	it will be skipped and its name will be omitted from any
	dependency output.  The ``--exclude`` option may be repeated to omit
	more than one branch from the output.  Limiting the output to a single
	branch that has been excluded will result in no output at all.

	The ``--tgish-only`` option behaves as though any non-TopGit-controlled
	dependencies encountered during processing had been listed after an
	``--exclude`` option.

	Note that the branch name can be specified as ``HEAD`` or ``@`` as a
	shortcut for the TopGit-controlled branch that ``HEAD`` is a
	symbolic ref to.  The ``tg summary @`` command can be quite useful.

	Options:
	  -i		Use TopGit metadata from the index instead of the branch
	  -w		Use TopGit metadata from the working tree instead of the branch

tg contains
~~~~~~~~~~~
	Search all TopGit-controlled branches (and optionally their remotes)
	to find which TopGit-controlled branch contains the specified commit.

	This is more than just basic branch containment as provided for by the
	``git branch --contains`` command.  While the shown branch name(s)
	will, indeed, be one (or more) of those output by the
	``git branch --contains`` command, the result(s) will exclude any
	TopGit-controlled branches from the result(s) that have one (or more)
	of their TopGit dependencies (either direct or indirect) appearing in
	the ``git branch --contains`` output.

	Normally the result will be only the one, single TopGit-controlled
	branch for which the specified committish appears in the ``tg log``
	output for that branch (unless the committish lies outside the
	TopGit-controlled portion of the DAG and ``--no-strict`` was used).

	In other words, if a ``tg patch`` is generated for the found branch
	(assuming one was found and a subsequent commit in the same branch
	didn't then revert or otherwise back out the change), then that patch
	will include the changes introduced by the specified committish
	(unless, of course, that committish is outside the TopGit-controlled
	portion of the DAG and ``--no-strict`` was given).

	This can be very helpful when, for example, a bug is discovered and
	then after using ``git bisect`` (or some other tool) to find the
	offending commit it's time to commit the fix.  But because the
	TopGit merging history can be quite complicated and maybe the one
	doing the fix wasn't the bug's author (or the author's memory is just
	going), it can sometimes be rather tedious to figure out which
	TopGit branch the fix belongs in.  The ``tg contains`` command can
	quickly tell you the answer to that question.

	With the ``--remotes`` (or ``-r``) option a TopGit-controlled remote
	branch name may be reported as the result but only if there is no
	non-remote branch containing the committish (this can only happen
	if at least one of the TopGit-controlled local branches are not yet
	up-to-date with their remotes).

	With the ``--verbose`` option show which TopGit DAG head(s) (one or
	more of the TopGit-controlled branch names output by
	``tg summary --heads``) have the result as a dependency (either direct
	or indirect).  Using this option will noticeably increase running time.

	With the default ``--strict`` option, results for which the base of the
	TopGit-controlled branch contains the committish will be suppressed.
	For example, if the committish was deep-down in the master branch
	history somewhere far outside of the TopGit-controlled portion of
	the DAG, with ``--no-strict``, whatever TopGit-controlled branch(es)
	first picked up history containing that committish will be shown.
	While this is a useful result it's usually not the desired result
	which is why it's not the default.

	To summarize, even with ``--remotes``, remote results are only shown
	if there are no non-remote results.  Without ``--no-strict`` (because
	``--strict`` is the default) results outside the TopGit-controlled
	portion of the DAG are never shown and even with ``--no-strict`` they
	will only be shown if there are no ``--strict`` results.  Finally,
	the TopGit head info shown with ``--verbose`` only ever appears for
	local (i.e. not a remote branch) results.

tg checkout
~~~~~~~~~~~
	Switch to a topic branch.  You can use ``git checkout <branch>``
	to get the same effect, but this command helps you navigate
	the dependency graph, or allows you to match the topic branch
	name using a regular expression, so it can be more convenient.

	There following subcommands are available:

	    ``tg checkout push``
				Check out a branch that directly
				depends on your current branch.

	    ``tg checkout pop``
				Check out a branch that this branch
				directly depends on.

	    ``tg checkout [goto] [--] <pattern>``
				Check out a topic branch that
				matches ``<pattern>``.  ``<pattern>``
				is used as a sed pattern to filter
				all the topic branches.  Both ``goto`` and
				``--`` may be omitted provided ``<pattern>``
				is not ``push``, ``pop``, ``-a``, ``--all``,
				``goto``, ``..``, ``--``, ``next``, ``child``,
				``prev``, ``parent``, ``-h`` or ``--help``.

	    ``tg checkout next``
				An alias for ``push``.

	    ``tg checkout child``
				An alias for ``push``.

	    ``tg checkout``
				An alias for ``push``.

	    ``tg checkout prev``
				An alias for ``pop``.

	    ``tg checkout parent``
				An alias for ``pop``.

	    ``tg checkout ..``
				An alias for ``pop``.

	If any of the above commands can find more than one possible
	branch to switch to, you will be presented with the matches
	and asked to select one of them.

	If the ``--ignore-other-worktrees`` (or ``--iow``) option is given and
	the current Git version is at least 2.5.0 then the full
	``--ignore-other-worktrees`` option will be passed along to the
	``git checkout`` command when it's run (otherwise the option will be
	silently ignored and not passed to Git as it would cause an error).

	The ``--force`` (or ``-f``) option, when given, gets passed through to
	the ``git checkout`` command.

	The ``<pattern>`` of ``tg checkout goto`` is optional.  If you don't
	supply it, all the available topic branches are listed and you
	can select one of them.

	Normally, the ``push`` and ``pop`` commands moves one step in
	the dependency graph of the topic branches.  The ``-a`` option
	causes them (and their aliases) to move as far as possible.
	That is, ``tg checkout push -a`` moves to a topic branch that
	depends (directly or indirectly) on the current branch and
	that no other branch depends on.  ``tg checkout pop -a``
	moves to a regular branch that the current topic branch
	depends on (directly or indirectly).  If there is more than
	one possibility, you will be prompted for your selection.

tg export
~~~~~~~~~
	Export a tidied-up history of the current topic branch and its
	dependencies, suitable for feeding upstream.  Each topic branch
	corresponds to a single commit or patch in the cleaned up
	history (corresponding basically exactly to ``tg patch`` output
	for the topic branch).

	The command has three possible outputs now -- either a Git branch
	with the collapsed history, a Git branch with a linearized
	history, or a quilt series in new directory.

	In the case where you are producing collapsed history in a new
	branch, you can use this collapsed structure either for
	providing a pull source for upstream, or for further
	linearization e.g. for creation of a quilt series using git log::

		git log --pretty=email -p --topo-order origin..exported

	To better understand the function of ``tg export``, consider this
	dependency structure::

	 origin/master - t/foo/blue - t/foo/red - master
	              `- t/bar/good <,----------'
	              `- t/baz      ------------'

	(where each of the branches may have a hefty history). Then::

	 master$ tg export for-linus

	will create this commit structure on the branch ``for-linus``::

	 origin/master - t/foo/blue -. merge - t/foo/red -.. merge - master
	              `- t/bar/good <,-------------------'/
	              `- t/baz      ---------------------'

	In this mode, ``tg export`` works on the current topic branch, and
	can be called either without an option (in that case,
	``--collapse`` is assumed), or with the ``--collapse`` option, and
	with one mandatory argument: the name of the branch where the
	exported result will be stored.

	When using the linearize mode::

	 master$ tg export --linearize for-linus

	you get a linear history respecting the dependencies of your
	patches in a new branch ``for-linus``.  The result should be more
	or less the same as using quilt mode and then reimporting it
	into a Git branch.  (More or less because the topological order
	can usually be extended in more than one way into a total order,
	and the two methods may choose different ones.)  The result
	might be more appropriate for merging upstream, as it contains
	fewer merges.

	Note that you might get conflicts during linearization because
	the patches are reordered to get a linear history.  If linearization
	would produce conflicts then using ``--quilt`` will also likely result
	in conflicts when the exported quilt series is applied.  Since the
	``--quilt`` mode simply runs a series of ``tg patch`` commands to
	generate the patches in the exported quilt series and those patches
	will end up being applied linearly, the same conflicts that would be
	produced by the ``--linearize`` option will then occur at that time.

	To avoid conflicts produced by ``--linearize`` (or by applying the
	``--quilt`` output), use the default ``--collapse`` mode and then use
	``tg rebase`` (or ``git rebase -m`` directly) on the collapsed branch
	(with a suitable <upstream>) followed by ``git format-patch`` on the
	rebased result to produce a conflict-free patch set.  A suitable
	upstream may be determined with the ``tg info --leaves`` command (if
	it outputs more than one line, linearization will be problematic).

	You have enabled ``git rerere`` haven't you?

	When using the quilt mode::

	 master$ tg export --quilt for-linus

	would create the following directory ``for-linus``::

	 for-linus/t/foo/blue.diff
	 for-linus/t/foo/red.diff
	 for-linus/t/bar/good.diff
	 for-linus/t/baz.diff
	 for-linus/series:
		t/foo/blue.diff -p1
		t/bar/good.diff -p1
		t/foo/red.diff -p1
		t/baz.diff -p1

	With ``--quilt``, you can also pass the ``-b`` parameter followed
	by a comma-separated explicit list of branches to export, or
	the ``--all`` parameter (which can be shortened to ``-a``) to
	export them all.  The ``--binary`` option enables producing Git
	binary patches.  These options are currently only supported
	with ``--quilt``.

	In ``--quilt`` mode the patches are named like the originating
	topgit branch.  So usually they end up in subdirectories of the
	output directory.  With the ``--flatten`` option the names are
	mangled so that they end up directly in the output dir (slashes
	are replaced with underscores).  With the ``--strip[=N]`` option
	the first ``N`` subdirectories (all if no ``N`` is given) get
	stripped off.  Names are always ``--strip``'d before being
	``--flatten``'d.  With the option ``--numbered`` (which implies
	``--flatten``) the patch names get a number as prefix to allow
	getting the order without consulting the series file, which
	eases sending out the patches.

	| TODO: Make stripping of non-essential headers configurable
	| TODO: Make stripping of [PATCH] and other prefixes configurable
	| TODO: ``--mbox`` option to export instead as an mbox file
	| TODO: support ``--all`` option in other modes of operation
	| TODO: For quilt exporting, export the linearized history created in
	        a temporary branch--this would allow producing conflict-less
	        series

tg import
~~~~~~~~~
	Import commits within the given revision range into TopGit,
	creating one topic branch per commit. The dependencies are set
	up to form a linear sequence starting on your current branch --
	or a branch specified by the ``-d`` parameter, if present.

	The branch names are auto-guessed from the commit messages and
	prefixed by ``t/`` by default; use ``-p <prefix>`` to specify an
	alternative prefix (even an empty one).

	Alternatively, you can use the ``-s NAME`` parameter to specify
	the name of the target branch; the command will then take one
	more argument describing a *single* commit to import.

tg update
~~~~~~~~~
	Update the current, specified or all topic branches with respect
	to changes in the branches they depend on and remote branches.
	This is performed in two phases -- first, changes within the
	dependencies are merged to the base, then the base is merged
	into the topic branch.  The output will guide you on what to do
	next in case of conflicts.

	You have enabled ``git rerere`` haven't you?

	When ``-a`` (or ``--all``) is specifed, updates all topic branches
	matched by ``<pattern>``'s (see ``git-for-each-ref(1)`` for details),
	or all if no ``<pattern>`` is given.  Any topic branches with missing
	dependencies will be skipped entirely unless ``--skip-missing`` is
	specified.

	When ``--skip-missing`` is specifed, an attempt is made to update topic
	branches with missing dependencies by skipping only the dependencies
	that are missing.  Caveat utilitor.

	When ``--stash`` is specified (or the ``topgit.autostash`` config
	value is set to ``true``), a ref stash will be automatically created
	just before beginning updates if any are needed.  The ``--no-stash``
	option may be used to disable a ``topgit.autostash=true`` setting.
	See the ``tg tag`` ``--stash`` option for details.

	After the update, if a single topic branch was specified, it is
	left as the current one; if ``-a`` was specified, it returns to
	the branch which was current at the beginning.

	If your dependencies are not up-to-date, ``tg update`` will first
	recurse into them and update them.

	If a remote branch update brings in dependencies on branches
	that are not yet instantiated locally, you can either bring in
	all the new branches from the remote using ``tg remote
	--populate``, or only pick out the missing ones using ``tg create
	-r`` (``tg summary`` will point out branches with incomplete
	dependencies by showing an ``!`` next to them).

	| TODO:	``tg update -a -c`` to autoremove (clean) up-to-date branches

tg push
~~~~~~~
	If ``-a`` or ``--all`` was specified, pushes all non-annihilated
	TopGit-controlled topic branches, to a remote repository.
	Otherwise, pushes the specified topic branches -- or the
	current branch, if you don't specify which.  By default, the
	remote gets all the dependencies (both TopGit-controlled and
	non-TopGit-controlled) and bases pushed to it too.  If
	``--tgish-only`` was specified, only TopGit-controlled
	dependencies will be pushed, and if ``--no-deps`` was specified,
	no dependencies at all will be pushed.

	The ``--dry-run`` and ``--force`` options are passed directly to
	``git push`` if given.

	The remote may be specified with the ``-r`` option. If no remote
	was specified, the configured default TopGit remote will be
	used.

tg base
~~~~~~~
	Prints the base commit of each of the named topic branches, or
	the current branch if no branches are named.  Prints an error
	message and exits with exit code 1 if the named branch is not
	a TopGit branch.

tg log
~~~~~~
	Prints the git log of the named topgit branch -- or the current
	branch, if you don't specify a name.

	This is really just a convenient shortcut for:

	    ``git log --first-parent --no-merges $(tg base <name>)..<name>``

	where ``<name>`` is the name of the TopGit topic branch (or omitted
	for the current branch).

	NOTE: if you have merged changes from a different repository, this
	command might not list all interesting commits.

tg tag
~~~~~~
	Creates a TopGit annotated/signed tag or lists the reflog of one.

	A TopGit annotated tag records the current state of one or more TopGit
	branches and their dependencies and may be used to revert to the tagged
	state at any point in the future.

	When reflogs are enabled (the default in a non-bare repository) and
	combined with the ``--force`` option a single tag name may be used as a
	sort of TopGit branch state stash.  The special branch name ``--all``
	may be used to tag the state of all current TopGit branches to
	facilitate this function and has the side-effect of suppressing the
	out-of-date check allowing out-of-date branches to be included.

	As a special feature, ``--stash`` may be used as the tag name in which
	case ``--all`` is implied if no branch name is listed (instead of the
	normal default of ``HEAD``), ``--force`` and ``--no-edit`` (use
	``--edit`` to change that) are automatically activated and the tag will
	be saved to ``refs/tgstash`` instead of ``refs/tags/<tagname>``.
	The ``--stash`` tag name may also be used with the ``-g``/``--reflog``
	option.

	The mostly undocumented option ``--allow-outdated`` will bypass the
	out-of-date check and is implied when ``--stash`` or ``--all`` is used.

	A TopGit annotated/signed tag is simply a Git annotated/signed tag with
	a "TOPGIT REFS" section appended to the end of the tag message (and
	preceding the signature for signed tags).  PEM-style begin and end
	lines surround one line per ref where the format of each line is
	full-hash SP ref-name.  A line will be included for each branch given
	on the command line and each ref they depend on either directly or
	indirectly.

	If more than one TopGit branch is given on the command line, a new
	commit will be created that has an empty tree and all of the given
	TopGit branches as parents and that commit will be tagged.  If a single
	TopGit branch is given, then it will be tagged.  If the ``--tree``
	option is used then it will be used instead of an empty tree (a new
	commit will be created if necessary to guarantee the specified tree is
	what's in the commit the newly created tag refers to).  The argument to
	the ``--tree`` option may be any valid treeish.

	All the options for creating a tag serve the same purpose as their Git
	equivalents except for two.  The ``--refs`` option suppresses tag
	creation entirely and emits the "TOPGIT REFS" section that would have
	been included with the tag.  If the ``--no-edit`` option is given and
	no message is supplied (via the ``-m`` or ``-F`` option) then the
	default message created by TopGit will be used without running the
	editor.

	With ``-g`` or ``--reflog`` show the reflog for a tag.  With the
	``--reflog-message`` option the message from the reflog is shown.
	With the ``--commit-message`` option the first line of the tag's
	message (if the object is a tag) or the commit message (if the object
	is a commit) falling back to the reflog message for tree and blob
	objects is shown.  The default is ``--reflog-message`` unless the
	``--stash`` (``refs/tgstash``) is being shown in which case the	default
	is then ``--commit-message``.  Just add either option explicitly to
	override the default.

	When showing reflogs, non-tag entries are annotated with their type
	unless ``--no-type`` is given.

	TopGit tags are created with a reflog if core.logallrefupdates is
	enabled (the default for non-bare repositories).  Unfortunately Git
	is incapable of showing an annotated/signed tag's reflog
	(using git log -g) as it will first resolve the tag before checking to
	see if it has a reflog.  Git can, however, show reflogs for lightweight
	tags (using git log -g) just fine but that's not helpful here.  Use
	``tg tag`` with the ``-g`` or ``--reflog`` option to see the reflog for
	an actual tag object.  This also works on non-TopGit annotated/signed
	tags as well provided they have a reflog.

	The number of entries shown may be limited with the ``-n`` option.  If
	the tagname is omitted then ``--stash`` is assumed.

	The ``--delete`` option is a convenience option that runs the
	``git update-ref -d`` command on the specified tag removing it and its
	reflog (if it has one).

	The ``--clear`` option clears all but the most recent (the ``@{0}``)
	reflog entries from the reflog for the specified tag.  It's equivalent
	to dropping all the higher numbered reflog entries.

	The ``--drop`` option drops the specified reflog entry and requires the
	given tagname to have an ``@{n}`` suffix where ``n`` is the reflog
	entry number to be dropped.   This is really just a convenience option
	that runs the appropriate ``git reflog delete`` command.

	Note that when combined with ``tg revert``, a tag created by ``tg tag``
	can be used to transfer TopGit branches.  Simply create the tag, push
	it somewhere and then have the recipient run ``tg revert`` to recreate
	the TopGit branches.  This may be helpful in situations where it's not
	feasible to push all the refs corresponding to the TopGit-controlled
	branches and their top-bases.

tg rebase
~~~~~~~~~
	Provides a ``git rebase`` rerere auto continue function.  It may be
	used as a drop-in replacement front-end for ``git rebase -m`` that
	automatically continues the rebase when ``git rerere`` information is
	sufficient to resolve all conflicts.

	You have enabled ``git rerere`` haven't you?

	If the ``-m`` or ``--merge`` option is not present then ``tg rebase``
	will complain and not do anything.

	When ``git rerere`` is enabled, previously resolved conflicts are
	remembered and can be automatically staged (see ``rerere.autoUpdate``).

	However, even with auto staging, ``git rebase`` still stops and
	requires an explicit ``git rebase --continue`` to keep going.

	In the case where ``git rebase -m`` is being used to flatten history
	(such as after a ``tg export --collapse`` prior to a
	``git format-patch``), there's a good chance all conflicts have already
	been resolved during normal merge maintenance operations so there's no
	reason ``git rebase`` could not automatically continue, but there's no
	option to make it do so.

	The ``tg rebase`` command provides a ``git rebase --auto-continue``
	function.

	All the same rebase options can be used (they are simply passed through
	to Git unchanged).  However, the ``rerere.autoUpdate`` option is
	automatically temporarily enabled while running ``git rebase`` and
	should ``git rebase`` stop asking one to resolve and continue, but all
	conflicts have already been resolved and staged using rerere
	information, then ``git rebase --continue`` will be automatically run.

tg revert
~~~~~~~~~
	Provides the ability to revert one or more TopGit branches and their
	dependencies to a previous state contained within a tag created using
	the ``tg tag`` command.  In addition to the actual revert mode
	operation a list mode operation is also provided to examine a tag's ref
	contents.

	The default mode (``-l`` or ``--list``) shows the state of one or more
	of the refs/branches stored in the tag data.  When no refs are given on
	the command line, all refs in the tag data are shown.  With the special
	ref name ``--heads`` then the indepedent heads contained in the tag
	data are shown.  The ``--deps`` option shows the specified refs and all
	of their dependencies in a single list with no duplicates.  The
	``--rdeps`` option shows a display similar to ``tg summary --rdeps``
	for each ref or all TopGit heads if no ref is given on the command
	line.  The standard ``--no-short``, ``--short=n`` etc. options may be
	used to override the default ``--short`` output.  With ``--hash`` (or
	``--hash-only``) show only the hash in ``--list`` mode in which case
	the default is ``--no-short``.   The ``--hash`` option can be used much
	like the ``git rev-parse --verify`` command to extract a specific hash
	value out of a TopGit tag.

	Note that unlike `tg summary`_, here ``--heads`` actually does mean the
	``git merge-base --independent`` heads of the stored refs from the tag
	data.  To see only the independent TopGit topic branch heads stored in
	the tag data use the ``--topgit-heads`` option instead.  The default
	for the ``--rdeps`` option is ``--topgit-heads`` but ``--heads`` can
	be given explicitly to change that.  (Note that ``--heads-independent``
	is accepted as an alias for ``--heads`` as well.)

	The revert mode has three submodes, dry-run mode (``-n`` or
	``--dry-run``), force mode (``-f`` or ``--force``) and interactive mode
	(``-i`` or ``--interactive``).  If ``--dry-run`` (or ``-n``) is given
	no ref updates will actually be performed but what would have been
	updated is shown instead.  If ``--interactive`` (or ``-i``) is given
	then the editor is invoked on an instruction sheet allowing manual
	selection of the refs to be updated before proceeding.  Since revert is
	potentially a destructive operation, at least one of the submodes must
	be specified explicitly.  If no refs are listed on the command line
	then all refs in the tag data are reverted.  Otherwise the listed refs
	and all of their dependencies (unless ``--no-deps`` is given) are
	reverted.  Unless ``--no-stash`` is given a new stash will be created
	using ``tg tag --stash`` (except, of course, in dry-run mode) just
	before actually performing the updates to facilitate recovery from
	accidents.

	Both modes accept fully-qualified (i.e. starts with ``refs/``) ref
	names as well as unqualified names (which will be assumed to be located
	under ``refs/heads/``).  In revert mode a tgish ref will always have
	both its ``refs/heads/`` and ``refs/top-bases/`` values included no
	matter how it's listed unless ``--no-deps`` is given and the ref is
	fully qualified (i.e. starts with ``refs/``) or one or the other of its
	values was removed from the instruction sheet in interactive mode.  In
	list mode a tgish ref will always have both its ``refs/heads/`` and
	``refs/top-bases/`` values included only when using the ``--deps`` or
	``--rdeps`` options.

	The ``--tgish-only`` option excludes non-tgish refs (i.e. refs that do
	not have a ``refs/heads/<name>``, ``refs/top-bases/<name>`` pair).

	The ``--exclude`` option (which can be repeated) excludes specific
	refs.  If the name given to ``--exclude`` is not fully-qualified (i.e.
	starts with ``refs/``) then it will exclude both members of a tgish ref
	pair.

	The ``--quiet`` (or ``-q``) option may be used in revert mode to
	suppress non-dry-run ref change status messages.

	The special tag name ``--stash`` (as well as with ``@{n}`` suffixes)
	can be used to refer to ``refs/tgstash``.

	The ``tg revert`` command supports tags of tags that contains TopGit
	refs.  So, for example, if you do this::

		tg tag newtag --all
		git tag -f -a -m "tag the tag" newtag newtag

	Then ``newtag`` will be a tag of a tag containing a ``TOPGIT REFS``
	section.  ``tg revert`` knows how to dereference the outermost
	tag to get to the next (and the next etc.) tag to find the
	``TOPGIT REFS`` section so after the above sequence, the tag ``newtag``
	can still be used successfully with ``tg revert``.

	NOTE:  If HEAD points to a ref that is updated by a revert operation
	then NO WARNING whatsoever will be issued, but the index and working
	tree will always be left completely untouched (and the reflog for
	the pointed-to ref can always be used to find the previous value).

tg prev
~~~~~~~
	Outputs the direct dependencies for the current or named branch.

	Options:
	  -i		show dependencies based on index instead of branch
	  -w		show dependencies based on working tree instead of branch

tg next
~~~~~~~
	Outputs all branches which directly depend on the current or
	named branch.

	Options:
	  -i		show dependencies based on index instead of branch
	  -w		show dependencies based on working tree instead of branch

tg migrate-bases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Transition top-bases from old location to new location.

	Beginning with TopGit release 0.19.4, TopGit has the ability to store
	the top-bases refs in either the old ``ref/top-bases/...`` location or
	the new ``refs/heads/{top-bases}/...`` location.  Starting with TopGit
	release 0.20.0, the default is the new location.

	By storing the top-bases under heads, Git is less likely to complain
	when manipulating them, hosting providers are more likely to provide
	access to them and Git prevents them from pointing at anything other
	than a commit object.  All in all a win for everyone.

	TopGit attempts to automatically detect whether the new or old location
	is being used for the top-bases and just do the right thing.  However,
	by explicitly setting the config value ``topgit.top-bases`` to either
	``refs`` for the old location or ``heads`` for the new location the
	auto-detection can be bypassed.  If no top-bases refs are present in
	the repository the default prior to TopGit release 0.20.0 is to use the
	old location but starting with TopGit release 0.20.0 the default is to
	use the new location.

	The ``tg migrate-bases`` command may be used to migrate top-bases refs
	from the old location to the new location (or, by using the
	undocumented ``--reverse`` option, vice versa).

	With few exceptions (``tg create -r`` and ``tg revert``), all top-bases
	refs (both local *and* remote refs) are expected to be stored in the
	same location (either new or old).  A repository's current location for
	storing top-bases refs may be shown with the ``tg --top-bases`` command.

TODO: tg rename
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

TopGit stores all the topic branches in the regular ``refs/heads/``
namespace (so we recommend distinguishing them with the ``t/`` prefix).
Apart from that, TopGit also maintains a set of auxiliary refs in
``refs/top-*``.  Currently, only ``refs/top-bases/`` is used, containing the
current *base* of the given topic branch -- this is basically a merge of
all the branches the topic branch depends on; it is updated during ``tg
update`` and then merged to the topic branch, and it is the base of a
patch generated from the topic branch by ``tg patch``.

All the metadata is tracked within the source tree and history of the
topic branch itself, in ``.top*`` files; these files are kept isolated
within the topic branches during TopGit-controlled merges and are of
course omitted during ``tg patch``.  The state of these files in base
commits is undefined; look at them only in the topic branches
themselves.  Currently, two files are defined:

	``.topmsg``:
	    Contains the description of the topic branch in a
	    mail-like format, plus the author information, whatever
	    Cc headers you choose or the post-three-dashes message.
	    When mailing out your patch, basically only a few extra
	    mail headers are inserted and then the patch itself is
	    appended.  Thus, as your patches evolve, you can record
	    nuances like whether the particular patch should have
	    To-list / Cc-maintainer or vice-versa and similar
	    nuances, if your project is into that.  ``From`` is
	    prefilled from your current ``GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT``; other
	    headers can be prefilled from various optional
	    ``topgit.*`` git config options.

	``.topdeps``:
	    Contains the one-per-line list of branches this branch
	    depends on, pre-seeded by ``tg create``. A (continuously
	    updated) merge of these branches will be the *base* of
	    your topic branch.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT EDIT ``.topdeps`` MANUALLY!!! If you do so, you need to
know exactly what you are doing, since this file must stay in sync with
the Git history information, otherwise very bad things will happen.

TopGit also automagically installs a bunch of custom commit-related
hooks that will verify whether you are committing the ``.top*`` files in a
sane state. It will add the hooks to separate files within the ``hooks/``
subdirectory, and merely insert calls to them to the appropriate hooks
and make them executable (but will make sure the original hook's code is
not called if the hook was not executable beforehand).

Another automagically installed piece is a ``.git/info/attributes``
specifier for an ``ours`` merge strategy for the files ``.topmsg`` and
``.topdeps``, and the (intuitive) ``ours`` merge strategy definition in
``.git/config``.


REMOTE HANDLING
---------------

There are two remaining issues with accessing topic branches in remote
repositories:

	(i) Referring to remote topic branches from your local repository
	(ii) Developing some of the remote topic branches locally

There are two somewhat contradictory design considerations here:

	(a) Hacking on multiple independent TopGit remotes in a single
	    repository
	(b) Having a self-contained topic system in local refs space

To us, (a) does not appear to be very convincing, while (b) is quite
desirable for ``git-log topic`` etc. working, and increased conceptual
simplicity.

Thus, we choose to instantiate all the topic branches of given remote
locally; this is performed by ``tg remote --populate``. ``tg update``
will also check if a branch can be updated from its corresponding remote
branch.  The logic needs to be somewhat involved if we are to "do the
right thing".  First, we update the base, handling the remote branch as
if it was the first dependency; thus, conflict resolutions made in the
remote branch will be carried over to our local base automagically.
Then, the base is merged into the remote branch and the result is merged
to the local branch -- again, to carry over remote conflict resolutions.
In the future, this order might be adjustable on a per-update basis, in
case local changes happen to be diverging more than the remote ones.
(See the details in `The Update Process`_ for more in depth coverage.)

All commands by default refer to the remote that ``tg remote --populate``
was called on the last time (stored in the ``topgit.remote`` git
configuration variable). You can manually run any command with a
different base remote by passing ``-r REMOTE`` *before* the subcommand
name.


TECHNICAL
---------

A familiarity with the terms in the GLOSSARY_ is helpful for understanding the
content of this sections.  See also the IMPLEMENTATION_ section.

The Update Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a branch is "updated" using the ``tg update`` command the following steps
are taken:

	1) The branch and all of its dependencies (and theirs recursively)
	   are checked to see which ones are *out-of-date*.  See glossary_.

	2) Each of the branch's direct dependencies (i.e. they are listed in
	   the branch's ``.topdeps`` file) which is out of date is updated
	   before proceeding (yup, this is a recursive process).

	3) Each of the branch's direct dependencies (i.e. they are listed in
	   the branch's ``.topdes`` file) that was updated in the previous
	   step is now merged into the branch's corresponding base.  If a
	   remote is involved, and the branch's corresponding base does NOT
	   contain the remote branch's corresponding base that remote base is
	   also merged into the branch's base at this time as well (it will be
	   the first item merged into the branch's base).

	4) If the branch has a corresponding remote branch and the branch
	   does not already contain it, it's merged into the branch's base
	   (which was possibly already updated in step (3) to contain the
	   remote branch's base but not the remote branch itself) on a detached
	   HEAD.  Yup, this step can be a bit confusing and no, the updated
	   base from step (3) has not yet been merged into the branch itself
	   yet either.  If there is no remote branch this step does not apply.
	   Using a detached HEAD allows the remote branch to be merged into the
	   contents of the base without actually perturbing the base's ref.

	5) If there is a remote branch present then use the result of step (4)
	   otherwise use the branch's base and merge that into the branch
	   itself.

That's it!  Simple, right? ;)

Unless the auto stash option has been disabled (see `no undo`_, `tg update`_
and `tg tag`_), a copy of all the old refs values will be stashed away
immediately after step (1) before starting step (2), but only if anything is
actually found to be out-of-date.

Merge Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``tg update`` command regularly performs merges while executing an update
operation.  In order to speed things up, it attempts to do in-index merges
where possible.  It accomplishes this by using a separate, temporary index
file and the ``git read-tree -m --aggressive`` command possibly assisted by
the ``git merge-index`` and ``git merge-file`` commands.  This combination may
be repeated more than once to perform an octopus in-index merge.  If this
fails, the files are checked out and a normal ``git merge`` three-way merge is
performed (possily multiple times).  If the normal ``git merge`` fails then
user intervention is required to resolve the merge conflict(s) and continue.

Since the ``tg annihilate``, ``tg create`` and ``tg depend add`` commands may
end up running the ``tg update`` machinery behind the scenes to complete their
operation they may also result in any of these merge strategies being used.

In addition to the normal Git merge strategies (if the in-index merging fails),
there are four possible TopGit merge strategies that may be shown.  Since they
all involve use of the ``git read-tree -m --aggressive`` command they are all
variations of a "trivial aggressive" merge.  The "trivial" part because all of
the merges done by ``git read-tree -m`` are described as "trivial" and the
"aggressive" part because the ``--aggressive`` option is always used.

	1) "trivial aggressive"
		Only two heads were involved and all merging was completed by
		the ``git read-tree -m --aggressive`` command.

	2) "trivial aggressive automatic"
		Only two heads were involved but after the
		``git read-tree -m --aggressive`` command completed there were
		still unresolved items and ``git merge-index`` had to be run
		(using the ``tg index-merge-one-file`` driver) which ultimately
		ran ``git merge-file`` at least once to perform a simple
		automatic three-way merge.  Hence the "automatic" description
		and the "Auto-merging ..." output line(s).

	3) "trivial aggressive octopus"
		This is the same as a "trivial aggressive" merge except that
		more than two heads were involved and after merging the first
		two heads, the ``git read-tree -m --aggressive`` step was
		repeated again on the result for each additional head.  All
		merging was completed via multiple
		``git read-tree -m --aggressive`` commands only.
		This beast is relatively rare in the wild.

	4) "trivial aggressive automatic octopus"
		This is very similar to the "trivial aggressive octopus"
		except that at least one of the ``git read-tree -m --aggressive``
		commands left unresolved items that were handled the same way
		as the "trivial aggressive automatic" strategy.  This species
		is commonly seen in the wild.


GLOSSARY
--------

	.topmsg
		Version-controlled file stored at the root level of each
		TopGit branch that contains the patch header for a TopGit
		branch.  See also IMPLEMENTATION_;

	.topdeps
		Version-controlled file stored at the root level of each
		TopGit branch that lists the branch's dependencies one per
		line omitting the leading ``refs/heads/`` part.  See also
		IMPLEMENTATION_;

	branch containment
		Given two Git commit identifiers (e.g. hashes) C1 and C2,
		commit C1 "contains" commit C2 if either they are the same
		commit or C2 can be reached from C1 by following one or more
		parent links from C1 (perhaps via one or more intermediate
		commits along the way).  In other words, if C1 contains C2
		then C2 is an ancestor of C1 or conversely C1 is a descendant
		of C2.  Since a TopGit branch name is also the name of a Git
		branch (something located under the ``refs/heads`` Git
		namespace) and similarly for a TopGit base, they can both be
		resolved to a Git commit identifier and then participate in
		a branch containment test.  An easy mnemonic for this is
		"children contain the genes of their parents."

	contains
		See branch containment.

	TopGit
		Excellent system for managing a history of changes to one
		or more possibly interrelated patches.

	TopGit branch
		A Git branch that has an associated TopGit base.  Conceptually
		it represents a single patch that is the difference between
		the associated TopGit base and the TopGit branch.  In other
		words ``git diff-tree <TopGit base> <TopGit branch>`` except
		that any ``.topdeps`` and/or ``.topmsg`` files are excluded
		from the result and the contents of the ``.topmsg`` file from
		the TopGit branch is prefixed to the result.

	TopGit base
		A Git branch that records the base upon which a TopGit branch's
		single conceptual "patch" is built.  The name of the Git branch
		is derived from the TopGit branch name by stripping off the
		leading ``refs/heads/`` and appending the correct prefix where
		all TopGit bases are stored (typically either
		``refs/top-bases/`` or ``refs/heads/{top-bases}/`` -- the
		prefix for any given repository can be shown by using the
		``tg --top-bases`` command and updated using the
		``tg migrate-bases`` command).

		All of a TopGit branch's dependencies are merged into the
		corresponding TopGit base during a ``tg update`` of a branch.

	base
		See TopGit base.

	TopGit ``[PATCH]`` branch
		A TopGit branch whose subject starts with ``[PATCH]``.  By
		convention these TopGit branches contain a single patch
		(equivalent to a single patch file) and have at least one
		dependency (i.e. their ``.topdeps`` files are never empty).

	TopGit ``[BASE]`` branch
		A TopGit branch whose subject starts with ``[BASE]``.  By
		convention these TopGit branches do not actually contain
		any changes and their ``.topdeps`` files are empty.  They
		are used to control a base dependency that another set of
		branches depends on.

	TopGit ``[STAGE]`` branch
		A TopGit branch whose subject starts with ``[STAGE]``.  By
		convention these TopGit branches do not actually contain any
		changes of their own but do have one or (typically) more
		dependencies in their ``.topdeps`` file.  These branches are
		used to bring together one or (typically) more independent
		TopGit ``[PATCH]`` branches into a single branch so that
		testing and/or evaluation can be performed on the result.

	merge conflict
		When merging two (or more) heads that touch the same lines in
		the file but in different ways the result is a merge conflict
		that requires manual intervention.  If a merge conflict occurs
		with more than two heads (an octopus merge) it's generally
		replaced by multiple three-way merges so that by the time a
		user sees a merge conflict needing manual resolution, there
		will be only two heads involved.

	merge strategy
		A Git merge strategy (see the "MERGE STRATEGIES" section of
		``git help merge``) or one of the TopGit `merge strategies`_
		used to merge two or more heads.

	TopGit merge strategy
		See the `Merge Strategies`_ section above for details but
		basically these are just in-index merges done using the
		``git read-tree -m --aggressive`` command one or more times
		possibily assisted by the ``git merge-index`` and the
		``git merge-file`` commands.

	octopus merge
		A merge involving more than two heads.  Note that if there are
		less than three independent heads the resulting merge that
		started out as an octopus will end up not actually being an
		octopus after all.

	out-of-date branch
		A TopGit branch is considered to be "out-of-date" when ANY of
		the following are true:

			a) The TopGit branch does NOT contain its
			   corresponding base.

			b) The TopGit branch does NOT contain its
			   corresponding remote branch (there may not be
			   a remote branch in which case this does not apply)

			c) The TopGit branch's base does NOT contain its
			   corresponding remote branch's base (there may not be
			   a remote branch in which case this does not apply)

			d) Any of the TopGit branches listed in the branch's
			   ``.topdeps`` file are NOT contained by the branch.
			   (See "branch containment" above.)

			e) Any of the TopGit branches listed in the branch's
			   ``.topdeps`` file are out-of-date.

		Note that if a remote branch is present and is NOT out-of-date
		then it will contain its own base and (c) is mostly redundant.

	remote TopGit branch
		A Git branch with the same branch name as a TopGit branch
		but living under ``refs/remotes/<some remote>/`` instead
		of just ``refs/heads/``.

	remote TopGit base
		The TopGit base branch corresponding to a remote TopGit branch,
		which lives under ``refs/remotes/`` somewhere (depending on
		what the output of ``tg --top-bases`` is for that remote).

	three-way merge
		A three-way merge takes a common base and two heads (call them
		A and B) and creates a new file that is the common base plus
		all of the changes made between the common base and head A
		*AND* all of the changes made between the common base and
		head B.  The technique used to accomplish this is called a
		"merge strategy".

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE
--------------------

The following software understands TopGit branches:

* `magit <http://magit.github.io/>`_ -- a git mode for emacs

IMPORTANT: Magit requires its topgit mode to be enabled first, as
described in its documentation, in the "Activating extensions"
subsection.  If this is not done, it will not push TopGit branches
correctly, so it's important to enable it even if you plan to mostly use
TopGit from the command line.
