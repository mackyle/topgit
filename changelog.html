<p>This release is a bug fix and maintenance release primarily intended to

improve test coverage of both local and remote updating.</p>

<p>A very few extra minor cosmetic updates are included as well.</p>

<p><em>Reminder</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TopGit 0.19.4 (2017-02-14) introduced support for a new top-bases location
     under heads.  This new location will become the default as of the TopGit
     0.20.0 release.  The current location under refs will continue to be
     supported in the future.  See <code>tg help migrate-bases</code> for more details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This release is primarily a bug fix and maintenance release.  A few extra
options may have slipped in here and there.  The test suite has grown immensely
which should help reduce future regressions.  One new feature did rear its head
way back at the last minute though.</p>

<h2 id="_posix_propaganda_">POSIX Propaganda</h2>

<p>With this release TopGit should be fully POSIX compliant once it has been
installed.  Installation and testing also require Perl, but as of this release
even the test suite can be run with just POSIX + Perl.  (If you want to make
the .html docs you will also need a .rst processor, but "shhhh" about that.)
It even works with some awks (I'm looking at you "mawk{1}") that aren't
actually fully POSIX compliant.</p>

<h2 id="_maintenance_maintenance_maintenance_">Maintenance Maintenance Maintenance</h2>

<p>A veritable plethora of fixes pervades this release.  There are now over 875
individual tests in 33 files.  Some things that probably should have worked
before (like <code>tg export --quilt --force</code> and <code>@</code> and <code>HEAD</code> being accepted as
aliases for the current branch everywhere it makes sense) do now.</p>

<p>Some more commands that should have worked in a read-only bare repository but
didn't now do.</p>

<p>There's more tolerance for "not-quite-POSIX" shells when running in what they
claim to be is a "POSIX" mode but really isn't all that.  Before choosing one
of them as TopGit's shell be sure to first run the test suite using that shell.
Not to worry, both bash and dash (when running as <code>/bin/sh</code>) are fine.</p>

<p>Bare branches (a TopGit branch with neither a .topmsg nor a .topdeps file) are
officially tolerated.  They mostly worked before; they work better now.</p>

<p>And speaking of <code>.topdeps</code> files, manually edited ones (naughty, naughty) that
are not quite up to snuff should cause fewer problems now.</p>

<p>An overall overhaul of <code>tg summary</code> resulted in a nice speed boost there
(probably the last it's likely to get as its stone has been squeezed dry now).</p>

<h2 id="_options_galore_">Options Galore</h2>

<p>The <code>tg export --quilt</code> mode now understands how to <code>--force</code> outputting to a
directory that already exists (and no longer commplains if the directory does
exist but is empty).</p>

<p>A new branch can be <code>tg create</code>d using <code>--no-update</code> to skip the final update
when more than one dependency is listed.</p>

<p>The <code>tg summary</code> command in list mode will include annihilated branches now
if you ask nicely (<code>--list --verbose --verbose</code> or just <code>-vvl</code>) and <code>tg info</code>
will even describe them properly too.</p>

<p>But back to <code>tg export</code> and its two other <code>--collapse</code> and <code>--linearize</code> modes;
It got a new <code>-s &lt;mode&gt;</code> option to specify how to handle subject lines
primarily focused on removal of <code>[PATCH]</code> and similar tags.  Instead of blindly
stripping everything off, the default now is to delicately remove only the
first <code>[...]</code> tag and only if it's one of the four TopGit knows about (those
would be "PATCH", "BASE", "ROOT" and "STAGE").  This should result in patches
that are imported and then exported keeping their same subject line.  But there
are five possible modes (including the previous "strip it all off") available
in an attempt to make sure everybody gets happy.</p>

<p>And last but not least there's one new global option...</p>

<h2 id="_the_wayback_machine_">The Wayback Machine</h2>

<p>A new feature slipped into this release at the last minute.  It comes with a
new global <code>-w &lt;tgtag&gt;</code> option and a new <code>shell</code> subcommand.</p>

<p>By specifying the name of a tag created using <code>tg tag</code> (or even automatically
via the auto stash functionality), a TopGit command can be run in the context
of the refs namespace recorded in that <code>tg tag</code>.  Either with all other refs
present and unchanged or with all other refs pruned away.</p>

<p>This functionality can be particularly useful in combination with <code>tg export</code>
to easily produce copies of older versions of a patch set.</p>

<p>The global <code>-w</code> option only permits use with read-only TopGit subcommands and
the new <code>shell</code> subcommand.</p>

<p>The new <code>tg shell</code> command will spawn a new copy of the shell (or execute a
specific command) with the current working directory set to a temporary
repository that shares the objects but has had its refs namespace altered to
the specified wayback state.  When the shell is exited it's all cleaned up
automatically, but there's even an option to place that "temporary" directory
somewhere else so that it can persist and be reused.</p>

<h1 id="_topgit-0_19_7_-_awesome_acceleration_">TopGit-0.19.7 - Awesome Acceleration</h1>

<h2 id="_2017-04-06_">2017-04-06</h2>

<h2 id="_awking_awesome_acceleration__">Awking Awesome Acceleration!</h2>

<p>It was supposed to be such a quick and simple update, surely it
would be done in no time at all.  And then it started growing...</p>

<p><strong>THE BIG AWKING CHANGE</strong></p>

<p>By moving the .topdeps traversal code into awk (strictly POSIX awk), everything
has become stupendously faster.  For example "tg summary --verbose --list" is
now nearly instant ("--verbose" is new and includes the subjects in the list).</p>

<p>The sole remaining bottlenecks are the git commands; generally checking for
some kind of branch containment (similar to "git branch --contains") or
performing actual merge operations themselves.</p>

<p>The results of branch containment checks continue to be cached and auto-updated
on an as-needed bases, but now with index-only merging support there's likely
little, if any, more water left to be squeezed out of the performance stone.</p>

<p><strong>NEW COMMAND</strong></p>

<p>"tg contains" (the original driver for this set of updates) shows what
TopGit branch a commit logically belongs to.   For example, after finding
something with "git log -S", passing the result to "tg contains" will show
which TopGit branch (if any) that commit logically belongs to (and where
any "fix" should therefore end up).</p>

<p><strong>POSIX MAKE INSTALLS</strong></p>

<p>While the tests still require gnumake, the build and installation now require
only a POSIX compatible make (and POSIX compatible utilities).</p>

<p><strong>UNIFIED "NEXT" AND "PREV" MEANINGS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The "tg prev" and "tg next" commands now show you exactly where the
corresponding "tg checkout next" and "tg checkout prev" will take you.</p></li>
<li><p>"tg info" understands new "--deps" and "--dependents" options if that's
what was really wanted in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>A new "NAVIGATION" section has been added to the documentation with
copious explanations and pictures explaining exactly what "next" and
"prev" really are, where the alternate "push", "pop", "child" and "parent"
terms come from and how to see the full patch series list or check it
out using "tg info --series" or "tg checkout --series" (yup those are
new too).</p></li>
<li><p>Along with this overhaul, "tg checkout", "tg next" and "tg prev" got
a few new options.  And, notabley, "tg checkout n" and "tg checkout p"
are shortcuts for "tg checkout next" and "tg checkout prev" respectively
(to use something else just employ the new "topgit.alias.*" functionality).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OTHER UPDATES</strong></p>

<p>Not necessarily a comprehensive list here, but these are notable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a 0.19.6 bug when "tg update" was returning to a detached HEAD
(If you never ran "tg update" with a detached HEAD you'd not see the bug)</p></li>
<li><p>Using TopGit with "git worktree add" repositories should work better now</p></li>
<li><p>"topgit.alias.<em>" now works for "tg" like "alias.</em>" works for "git"</p></li>
<li><p>"tg summary" has a new column showing "needs merge" branches
(these are the ones with changes that are causing others to be out-of-date)</p></li>
<li><p>Both "tg create" and "tg update" now take a "--base" option (aka --no-deps
for "tg create"), to simplify "[BASE]" TopGit branch setup and maintenance</p></li>
<li><p>"tg update" now automatically just keeps going and going if "rerere.enabled"
is true and "rerere" was able to resolve all merge conflicts</p></li>
<li><p>tg checkout will pass along --ignore-other-worktrees (aka --iow), --force
(aka -f), --quiet (aka -q) and/or --merge (aka -m) to git checkout now</p></li>
<li><p>The "--heads" option now works as originally intended in various places</p></li>
<li><p>"tg patch" can add a missing "From:" header to its output patch with --from
("git am" really, really, really doesn't like patches without "From:" lines)</p></li>
<li><p>"tg" can now be used on read-only repositories!  The temporary trees some
operations need now end up in an "alternate" object store that's removed
when the command completes and while this temporary location is inside
TopGit's temporary directory, that now auto-relocates elsewhere if the
repository is read-only.  Obviously, "tg" commands that make changes still
won't work on a read-only repository.  :)</p></li>
<li><p>The ".topfiles" (i.e. .topdeps and .topmsg) are now kept out of the bases
when merging updates from dependencies into the base.  They are not
logically part of the base and this keeps the bases cleaner.  "tg create"
now also makes sure the initial base has no ".topdeps" or ".topmsg" either
which nicely cleans up the ugly diffs of one TopGit branch's .topfiles
against another's in "git log -p" output.</p></li>
<li><p>Merging remote branch updates into the local branch no longer quietly
discards .topmsg and/or .topdeps changes from the remote branch version
(previously they might have been picked up or might have been discarded)</p></li>
<li><p>"tg log" now supports "--compact" and "--command=&lt;cmd>" to use something
other than plain "log" to show the log</p></li>
<li><p>A new "--no-pager" global option for all "tg" commands works like Git's</p></li>
<li><p>"tg tag" allows the first parent of a consolidation commit (if needed) to be
explicitly selected</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_2017-03-05_">2017-03-05</h2>

<p>Small bug fix release</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When an octopus merge fails suppress simple merges for all of
the affected heads not just the failing ones because if one of them
needs to use a recursive merge to be successful then the rest need
to also use that logic to avoid unexpected merge results.</p></li>
<li><p>The pre-loaded commit message when using tg create with multiple
dependencies now survives the base merge again (regression fix)
and the pre-loaded message is now suppressed for all but '[PATCH]'
TopGit branches.</p></li>
<li><p>The tg update process can now return to any non-unborn HEAD.</p></li>
<li><p>The tg patch output will now survive passing through diff-highlight
without being corrupted (workaround for diff-highlight bug).</p></li>
<li><p>If tg create would fail when it goes to checkout the first dependency
then it will now fail right away before prompting for any messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Special characters (including spaces) in the repository's path no longer
cause problems with the TopGit cache (mostly a regression fix).</p></li>
<li><p>Some more tests have been added as well as minor testing framework
improvements.</p></li>
<li><p>The TopGit-specific index-only merge strategies are now described in
full in the README file (accessible via <code>tg help tg</code> or <code>tg help -w tg</code>).</p></li>

<h2 id="_2017-02-15_">2017-02-15</h2>

<p>Small bug fix and update release</p>

<p>The <code>git rev-parse --git-common-dir</code> command is broken when run in
a subdirectory of the top level of a normal Git checkout.  This is
now worked around by cd'ing to the top level before using it.</p>

<p>The tg base command now understands the standard <code>--short</code>,
<code>--short=n</code> and <code>--no-short</code> options to control the number of hash
digits shown.</p>

<p>The subcommand <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> options can now be used outside of
a Git repository.</p>

<p>An initial batch of tests has been added that cover the common global
tg options and setup (and the broken rev-parse --git-common-dir issue).</p>

<h2 id="_there_be_octopuses_here__">There be octopuses here!</h2>

<p>tg update now prefers to perform index-only merges where possible
and will now make octopus merges when only simple in-index merge
resolution can be accomplished.  It now also uses a --continue
mechanism rather than the prior subshell mechanism for conflict
resolution and supports multiple explicit branch names without the
<code>-a</code> option.</p>

<p>The tg annihilate, tg create and tg depend add (which now allows
multiple dependencies to be added at once) all run <code>tg update</code>
under the hood as the final step so they too can end up creating
an octopus merge.</p>

<p>A new <code>tg status</code> command has been added to show the current state
of any pending tg operation that's awaiting user action (along
with a helpful list of the correct commands to use to
continue/abort the action).</p>

<h2 id="_just_a_few_tiny_updates_">Just a few tiny updates</h2>

<p>Other than already mentioned in the above section, the <code>tg tag</code>
command has a new <code>--tree</code> option to force a particular tree to be
used in the tag.</p>

<p>The <code>tg revert</code> command now understands the standard <code>--short=n</code>,
<code>--no-short</code> and <code>--short</code> options when showing the contents of a
TopGit tag as well as the new <code>--hash</code> option to only show the
hash (lets it work similarly to the <code>git rev-parse --verify</code>
command to extract hashes from a TopGit tag).</p>

<p>The <code>tg revert</code> command will now accept a bare hash value when
reverting if it's the hash of a TopGit tag.</p>

<p>The <code>tg summary</code> command has a convenient <code>--heads-only</code> option
that limits the output to independent heads only.</p>

<p>The <code>tg info</code> command has a new <code>--leaves</code> option to show the
leaves of the TopGit portion of the graph which is extremely
helpful when determining what the correct commit to rebase onto
should be when creating a linearized patch output (it should be
the single line output by <code>tg info --leaves</code> -- bad news if more
than one line comes out).</p>

<p>Like Git, TopGit will now accept <code>@</code> for <code>HEAD</code>.</p>

<h2 id="_correctness_cleanup_git_accomodations_and_minor_bug_fixes_">Correctness, cleanup, git accomodations and minor bug fixes</h2>

<p>Some sh-is-bash bugs have been accomodated, the <code>-r</code> option should
now really be usable with <code>tg create</code> (it's now properly parsed),
any branch names passed to <code>tg update</code> using the <code>-a</code> option
should now be honored again (broken since 0.18.0), multiple <code>-b</code>
options to the <code>tg export --quilt</code> command now work, the <code>tg
revert</code> command will now detach your HEAD if it modifies the ref a
symbolic-ref HEAD points to, the topgit.autostash boolean now
defaults to true if not set -- it will save your butt so better
it's on by default and a few Git idiosyncracies are now better
accomodated (early detection of no valid ident and supplying
--allow-unrelated-histories to git merge for v2.9.0+, multiple
work trees since v2.5.0, core.hooksPath since v2.9.0).</p>

<p>Git version 1.8.5 or later is now required.  It has actually been
required since 0.19.0 but was not being checked for.  The reason
is the use of the cat-file --batch-check command and its new
<code>%(rest)</code> format -- there really isn't any good alternative for it
and Git 1.8.5 was released over three years ago at this point (and
Git versions prior to 2.4.11 have known security issues and really
should be avoided anyhow).</p>

<p>With this release, hopefully all ref ambiguity and quoting issues
have been resolved and any valid Git branch name should now be
useable as a TopGit branch name.</p>

<h2 id="_new_top-bases_location_">New Top-Bases Location</h2>

<p>TopGit now allows the top-bases refs to be stored under refs/heads
(as they are really branches) rather than bare refs/.  The new
<code>tg migrate-bases</code> command (and associated help) talk about this
and there's a new preference <code>topgit.top-bases</code> (can be set to
"refs" or "heads" or left unset for auto) and new <code>tg --top-bases</code>
option to show the value for the current repository.</p>

<p>The default is still to store the top-bases in the same refs/
location as always but starting with release 0.20.0 the default
will change to the new location.  All commands should now,
howevver, accomodate either location (but you cannot mix and
match, it's one or the other) automatically detecting whatever is
in use in the repository by default.</p>

<h2 id="_testing_framework_">Testing Framework</h2>

<p>There is a new testing framework (adopted from Git but modified)
now present in the "t/" subdirectory.  Currently it only tests the
testing framework but more tests will be added in the future.</p>

<h1 id="_topgit-0_19_-_undo_at_last_">TopGit-0.19 - Undo At Last</h1>

<h2 id="_2015-11-20_">2015-11-20</h2>

<p>A major TopGit update.</p>

<p>Major new commands include <code>tg tag</code> and <code>tg revert</code>.  When combined,
<code>tg tag</code> and <code>tg revert</code> can provide a kind of <code>tg update</code> undo.
See the new "NO UNDO" section in the README.  A new <code>tg rebase</code>
command is also included to provide a <code>git rebase --auto-continue</code>
functionality.  The use of <code>tg create</code> has been greatly streamlined
and it learned several new options to specify <code>.topmsg</code> content.
Furthermore, TopGit branches with no dependencies (an empty <code>.topdeps</code>
file) are now officially supported with the new <code>tg create</code> <code>--no-deps</code>
option.</p>

<p>New with this release TopGit attempts to keep commits that change
<code>.topdeps</code> and/or <code>.topmsg</code> separate from other changes.  See the
new "SEQUESTRATION" section in the README for details.</p>

<p>The <code>tg summary</code> command learned several new options most notably
the <code>--heads</code> option which can be combined with <code>--rdeps</code> (as
<code>tg summary --rdeps --heads</code>).</p>

<p>The <code>tg</code> command learned to accept <code>-c &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code> options to
be passed through to any git commands that are run.</p>

<p>The <code>tg delete</code> command learned to detach your HEAD (thereby allowing
deletion of the HEAD branch) with <code>-f -f</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>tg info</code> command learned a new <code>--heads</code> option to tell which
of the <code>tg summary --heads</code> the specified branch is contained in.</p>

<p>The <code>tg update</code> command learned <code>--stash</code> and <code>--no-stash</code> and to
pay attention to the config value of <code>topgit.autostash</code> (see the
new "NO UNDO" section in the README for details).</p>

<p>The <code>tg checkout</code> command implicitly understands to 'goto' when
the word 'goto' is omitted and the argument is not another subcommand.</p>

<p>SHELL_PATH can now be set in <code>config.mak</code> to specify a POSIX shell
other than /bin/sh to use with the installed tg commands.</p>

<p>The README has been expanded somewhat and now contains an alphabetical
list of all subcommands in the USAGE section which become links
when the <code>topgit.html</code> file is generated.  Furthermore, the non-html
version used for <code>tg help tg</code> now contains the same usage lines the
html version does.  A new "CONVENTIONS" section is also included
to explain the three different kinds of TopGit branches commonly
used ("patch", "base" and "stage").</p>

<p>Various bug fixes are included.  <code>tg export --linearize</code> will no
longer abort prematurely when faced with branches that do not share
a common base somewhere in their ancestry.  Pre-existing pre-commit
hooks are no longer assumed to use <code>#!/bin/sh</code> as their interpreter.
When output is not being paged an extra <code>cat</code> process is no longer
run.</p>

<p>A regression (since 0.18) and bug fix (when using older bash) for
the pre-commit hook are included.</p>

<p>A Git compatibility update to set LESS to '-FRX' instead of '-FRSX'
to match Git behavior since v2.1.0 is also included.</p>

<h2 id="_2015-10-16_">2015-10-16</h2>

<p>The focus of this release is speed.</p>

<p>Through addition of a $GIT_DIR/tg-cache directory many tg operations have
been significantly sped up.  Running <code>tg summary</code> will cause the cache to
be updated.</p>

<p>A few other items slipped in.  <code>tg summary</code> can now take more than one
branch name to list just those.  <code>tg summary --rdeps</code> now, correctly,
includes non-tgish depedencies in its output again (regression since 0.14).
Lastly, <code>tg summary</code> now accepts <code>--list</code> as an alias for <code>-t</code>.</p>

<h1 id="_topgit-0_17_">TopGit-0.17</h1>

<h2 id="_2015-10-03_">2015-10-03</h2>

<p>A polish and bug fix release.  Notably tg summary, tg info, tg update and
anything else that needs to traverse the entire dependency graph should
work much faster now when a large .topdeps dependency graph is involved.</p>

<p>Other niceties like optional remote branch name for tg create -r (assumes
its the same as the local name in that case), tg patch can now pass along
arbitrary options to git diff-tree in order to better inspect the potential
patch.  Also the temporary directory used in .git should always be removed
now, tg export --collapse creates unique committer timestamps on the commits
it synthesizes so any git rebase run on the result has a stable ordering
with respect to the TopGit .topdeps dependency tree and finally tg create
preloads a suggested commit message.</p>

<p>The tg summary command also got some love and --deps can now work on a
single branch, using --rdeps now changes the default from all branches to
the current branch and lastly one or more branches can be excluded from
tg summary's output.</p>

<p>Primarily a bug fix release, but two minor features did
creep in.  A global <code>-u</code> option is now supported to pretend
that topgit.remote is not set.  Both tg patch and tg export
now accept <code>--binary</code> to enable producing Git binary patches.</p>

<p>Notable fixes make tg work properly from non top-level Git
working directories, make tg export work properly with
--force and with a tgish first depedency, enable ref logs
for top-bases when core.logallrefupdates is true and honor
the Git core.pager and pager.diff settings (so that something
like contrib/diff-highlight works properly).</p>

<p>This is TopGit v0.4, continuing its mission of practical usability.
I have managed to somehow use this to actually manage a rather large
and non-trivial system of git-gui patches, recently submitted to git@.
(I send out the mail series using tg export --quilt and quilt mail
so far though, and I'm actually finding that quite convenient.)</p>

<p>The nicest thing about this release is Kirill's new 'tg mail' command,
'tg export --quilt -b' to create quilt series from arbitrary set of
topic branches and 'tg depend add', which has actually quite trivial
implementation, though. Then there's the usual bunch of small
enhancements and fixes.</p>

<h2 id="_2008-09-10_">2008-09-10</h2>

<p>After awfully long delay, here comes v0.3 of TopGit - we hopefully start
to approach some kind of practical usability by now.</p>

<p>Aside of few minor changes, the major point of this release is remotes
handling; you can elevate any remote to a TopGit-tracked status using
'tg remote', then git fetch / push will haul around the TopGit bases
as well, and 'tg update' can update your local branches based on
the remote ones. Each repository has one "default" TopGit remote and
the local branches are supposed to reflect this one; that is the remote
'tg update' and all the other commands consider by default. Normally,
this remote is the last one you called 'tg remote --populate' on, but
you can change it in .git/config or switch it for a particular tg call
using the 'tg -r REMOTE command' parameter.</p>

<p>The other major improvement is new 'tg import' command by Aneesh Kumar
that lets you transform a series of commits to a topic branch sequence.
I decided not to consider the 'tg depend' work by Jan Nieuwenhuiz for this
release yet, since it will probably take me a bit of time yet to fully
understand his approach; so far, I have an uneasy feel about it.</p>

<p>Note that this release, as usual, received only very light testing - please
come back with any bugs you find. If someone would feel like adding at least
a simple testsuite, that would be really nice.</p>

<p>This is v0.2 of TopGit; we are steady on our way to v1.0! ;-)
This version features changed usage of tg create, new tg export command
that can export your patch queue either to a Git branch or Quilt series,
a huge amount of bugfixes, and improved documentation infrastructure.</p>

<p>Thanks go to Bert Wesarg, Russel Steicke and Antonio Ospite for their
patches - please keep them coming - and to martin f. krafft for
the testing, ideas and presentation to fellow Debian packagers.</p>
