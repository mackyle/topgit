Test Files
==========

All tests are shell scripts and must be named to
match:

    t[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.sh

They must output TAP (Test Anything Protocol) compliant
format.  In particular, only version 12 format is supported,
NOT version 13.  See `perldoc Test::Harness::TAP` for extensive
details on the format.  A more formal grammar can be found
in `perldoc TAP::Parser::Grammar` if desired.  See also
`perldoc TAP::Parser` and <http://testanything.org> as well for
copies of the specification.

All tests are run with the current directory set to the same
directory as the directory containing the test file itself.


------------
Test Library
------------

A testing library is available to facilitate writing tests.

It should be sourced by test scripts wanting to use it AFTER
setting the "test_description" variable and then calling the
provided functions to produce TAP output like so:

    test_description='title of test goes here
    
    And any more lines go here much like a standard Git
    checkin comment although there's no requirement that
    the description follow any partiuclar layout.  It's
    only used by the -h|--help functionality.
    '
    
    . ./test-lib.sh
    
    test_expect_success 'small test' '
    	# do some testing
    	...
    '
    
    ...
    
    test_done

For more detailed information on how to use the test-lib.sh
testing library see the README-TESTLIB and README-WRITING-TESTS
files.

TAP - A Quick Overview
----------------------

Only output to STDOUT is examined and
must consist of one of four kinds of lines:

  1) A test plan line matching either:
     a) "^1..n$" where n is a positive integer
     b) "^1..0(?![0-9]).*?#\s*(?i)SKIP\S*\s+(.*)$" where $1 is skip reason
        (this format is only valid if there are no test lines)
     There MUST BE EXACTLY ONE test plan line and it must appear either
     BEFORE ALL or AFTER ALL of the test lines.  For example, the following
     line plans four tests:
         1..4

  2) Test lines which must either be ALL BEFORE or ALL AFTER the test plan line
     a) "^ok(?:\s+$stuff?)?$" test succeeds
     b) "^not ok(?:\s+$stuff?)?$" test fails
     There must be n test lines where n (possibly 0) is from the test plan.
     If present, $stuff should match
        "(\d+)?\s*([^#]*)(?:#\s*(?i)(SKIP|TODO)\b(.*))?"
     where $1 is the test number and if present must be correct (tests are
     numbered starting with 1).  $2 is the optional test description and it's
     customary to start it with "- " to make the output look nice.  If present,
     $3 is a directive and $4 is the reason for it.  An "ok #TODO" is a known
     breakage that isn't actually broken.  A "not ok #TODO" is a known breakage
     (that's still broken).  An "ok #SKIP" is a skipped test.  A "not ok #SKIP"
     is treated the same as a "not ok" test.  For example, the following shows
     four test lines for good, skip, bad and known broken respectively:
         ok 1 - test that works
	 ok 2 - test might work # SKIP need missing thingamajig to run
         not ok 3 - test that should have worked
	 not ok 4 - test known not to work # TODO fix this problem

  3) Diagnostic/Comment lines matching "^#" which are ignored for TAP purposes
     (If the '#' isn't in column 1 then it's technically an "other" line.)
     Some harnesses have an option to show comments and "other" lines do NOT
     qualify, only lines matching "^#" are considered "comments".  For example,
     all of the following are recognized as comment/diagnostice lines:
         # Hello
	 #   some random gobbledygook
	 # Lines may be located anywhere in the output

  4) An emergency stop line matching "^\s*Bail out!\s*(.*)$" (yes, it IS
     case-sensitive).  The value of $1 will be shown if present.
     (A well-written test emits a '1..0 # SKIP ...' line instead, but if
     something unrecoverable goes wrong in the middle of testing a "Bail out!"
     line is useful.)  For example:
         Bail out! my microphone is broken
     When using prove to run multiple tests a 'Bail out!' line will abort all
     further testing when it's encountered (including any yet-to-be-run tests).

The handling of other lines is unspecified although generally they are treated
as lines to be ignored, but should the TAP standard change there is no
guarantee they will continue to be so treated.
