TopGit Testing Library
======================

The TopGit testing library consists of TopGit-specific additions to the testing
library that are automatically available whenever the standard testing library
functions and variables are.

Familiarity with the standard testing library functions and variables as
described in `README-TESTLIB` can provide valuable assistance in understanding
the contents of this file.

The functions described here are defined in the `test-lib-functions-tg.sh`
file which contains copious comments for each one should the more succinct
descriptions included here prove insufficiently enlightening.

----------------
TopGit Variables
----------------

- TG_TEST_FULL_PATH

    Set by the testing library to the full absolute path to the `tg` executable
    being used for testing.

- tg_test_bases

    Location of "top-bases" refs for `tg_test_v_getbases` function.  May have
    any of these values:

      * "" (the empty string or unset)  
        default top-bases location for this release of TopGit (default value)
      * `refs`  
        Use `refs/top-bases` or `refs/remotes/`<remote-name>`/top-bases`
      * `heads`  
        Use `refs/heads/{top-bases}` or
        `refs/remotes/`<remote-name>`/{top-bases}`
      * anything else  
        exit immediately with a fatal error when `tg_test_v_getbases` is called

- tg_test_remote

    Remote name to use when `tg_test_v_getremote` is called with no remote or
    with an empty remote name argument.  A fatal error will occur if the
    `tg_test_v_getname` function is called with an empty or omitted remote name
    and this variable is unset or empty (the default value).


------------------------
TopGit Utility Functions
------------------------

- tg_test_bare_tree [-C <dirpath>] <treeish>

    Output the hash of the tree equivalent to <treeish>^{tree} with any
    top-level .topdeps and .topmsg files removed.  The returned tree is
    guaranteed to exist in the object database.

    The output tree hash will be located in the current repository unless
    -C <dirpath> is used in which case it will be located in that Git
    repository instead.

- tg_test_create_branch [-C <dirpath>] [--notick] [+][\][[<remote>]:[:]]<branch>
  [--no-topmsg] [-m "message"] [:[:[:]][~]]<start> [<dep>...]

    Create a new TopGit branch (head and base) named <branch>.  If the
    [<remote>]: prefix is given it will be a remote TopGit branch only (using
    `tg_test_remote` if the [<remote>] part is empty) or BOTH a local AND
    remote TopGit branch if the [<remote>]:: prefix (double-colon) form is
    used.

    Unless --notick is used the `test_tick` function will be called before
    creation of each new commit.  All of the refs to be created must not
    already exist or a fatal error will occur.

    The new <branch> will be created in the current repository unless
    -C <dirpath> is used in which case it will be created in that Git
    repository instead.

    Unless the leading "+" is present the branch and its associated base
    (local, remote or local and remote depending on the ":" prefix part)
    MUST NOT already exist.  With "+" any pre-existing values are stepped on.
    A leading "\" will be stripped from the branch name allowing branch names
    that start with "+" to be specified as "\+branch" without having the "+"
    be interpreted as the overwrite option.

    If -m "message" is omitted the default is "branch <branch>", but if
    --no-topmsg is used instead the branch will not have any .topmsg file at
    all (just like a bare branch, but it could still have a .topdeps file).
    The message, if given, will still be used for the commit message though.

    The branch's starting point will be <start> which must be the name of an
    existing branch under refs/heads and it will also be included as the first
    line of the created .topdeps file.

    However, if the :[:[:]]<start> form is used then <start> can be any
    existing committish and it will NOT be included in the created .topdeps
    file.  If the :~<start> form is used then it works the same way as just
    :<start> except that the branch will not have a .topdeps file at all (just
    like a bare branch, but it could still have a .topmsg file).

    If two colons (e.g. "::start") are used then the created branch will be
    bare and not have any .topdeps or .topmsg file and the [<dep>...]
    arguments are forbidden.  This is a convenience to save typing as the
    same thing can be accomplished using --no-topmsg and :~<start>.

    If three colons are used (e.g. ":::start") the [<dep>...] arguments are
    also forbidden, no additional .topdeps or .topmsg files added (but
    existing ones in <start> will be left alone), the bases will NOT be
    created (making it a non-TopGit branch) but they must also not exist
    (unless "+" was used) and it will have a commit made on it in the style of
    `test_commit` (except that only the message can be specified, the <file>,
    <contents> and <tag> always use default values as described for
    `test_commit`).  Note that since unlike the `test_commit` function, the
    default message is "branch <<branch>" no tag will be created by default.
    To cause a tag to be created, an explicit, single-word, refname-friendly
    message must be provided.

    With the :[:[:][~]]<start> form only, <start> may be the
    empty string to start from a new empty tree root commit (or no parent at
    all in the ":::" case).

    Note that by combining the "+"<branch> form with a :::<start> line where
    both <branch> and <start> are the same, more commits can be added to a
    pre-existing branch.

    Each given <dep> argument will be added as a line to the created .topdeps
    file as-is WITHOUT ANY VALIDATION (except they are forbidden for bare
    branches and will cause a fatal error in that case if given).

    The repository in which the branches are created is left unmolested (i.e.
    its working tree, index and symbolic-ref value of HEAD are unchanged).
    However, if HEAD was a symbolic-ref to an unborn branch that's then created
    by this function that could impact Git's interpretation of the worktree and
    index.

- tg_test_create_branches [-C <dirpath>] [--notick]

    Read `tg_branch_create` instructions from standard input and then call
    `tg_test_create_branch` for each set of instructions.

    Standard input must be a sequence of line groups each consisting of two or
    more non-empty lines where the groups are separated by a single blank line.
    Each line group must have this form:

        [+][\][[<remote>]:[:]]<branch> [--no-topmsg] [optional] [message] [here]
        [[delete]:[:[:]][~]]<start>
        [<dep>]
        [<dep>]
        ...

    Note that any <dep> lines must not be empty.  If there are no <dep>s, then
    there must be no <dep> lines at all.

    See the description of `tg_test_create_branch` for the meaning of the
    arguments.  The provided <dirpath> and `--notick` options are passed along
    on each call to `tg_test_create_branch`.

    The "delete:[:[:]]<start>" form is an extension not handled by the
    `tg_test_create_branch` function.  With "delete", a message is forbidden,
    no <dep> lines are allowed and if <start> is not empty the branch to be
    deleted must have the specified <start> value for the delete to succeed.
    If the "delete:::" (three colon) form is used then any pre-existing base(s)
    are ignored otherwise they will be removed.  Note that since there is only
    one <start> value, if <start> is not empty, all refs (1, 2 or 4) to be
    deleted must have that same <start> value.  Also note that "delete:..."
    never removes any tags.  If <start> is left empty AND the leading "+" is
    NOT present then all refs to be deleted must actually exist.

    This function can be used to easily create a complicated deterministic
    TopGit DAG for testing purposes.  Since each line group represents a call
    to `tg_test_create_branch`, later groups may use any branch name created
    by an earlier group as a <start> point.

- tg_test_create_tag [-C <dir>] [--notick] [-t] <tag> [<for-each-ref-pat>...]

    If no for-each-ref patterns are given then refs/heads, refs/top-bases and
    refs/remotes are used.  Only refs that have type `commit` will be put in
    the tag.  The result will be a new annotated tag <tag> that can be used
    as a source for `tg revert` (and therefore the `tg -w` option too).

    The for-each-ref-pat arguments are passed directly to `git for-each-ref`
    and may therefore use all wildcard features available with that command.

    Unlike ordinary `tg tag` tags, the resulting tags tag the empty blob (or
    with -t the empty tree) and there is no consolidation commit made at all,
    ever.

- tg_test_include [-C <dirpath>] [-r <remote>] [-u] [-f]

    Source tg in `tg__include=1` mode to provide access to internal tg
    functions.

    If TG_TEST_FULL_PATH is unset a fatal error will occur.

    The following options are available:

      * `-C` <dirpath>  
        Temporarily `cd` to <dirpath> before sourcing `tg`, but then return
        to the original `$PWD` afterwards.
      * `-r` <remote>  
        Set `base_remote` to "<remote>" *before* sourcing `tg`.
      * `-u`  
        Unset `base_remote` *after* sourcing `tg`.
      * `-f`  
        Terminate with a fatal error instead of returning a non-0 result code

    The `tg__include` variable will be left set to `1` after calling this
    function.  The `base_remote` variable will remain set/unset after calling
    this function solely based on the presence/absence of any `-r` and/or `-u`
    options and the behavior of the sourced `tg` file.

- tg_test_setup_topgit [-C <dirpath>] [-f]

    Perform TopGit merge and hook setup for a repository if it's not already
    been done.

    If TG_TEST_FULL_PATH is unset a fatal error will occur.

    The following options are available:

      * `-C` <dirpath>  
        Temporarily `cd` to <dirpath> before sourcing `tg`, but then return
        to the original `$PWD` afterwards.
      * `-f`  
        Terminate with a fatal error instead of returning a non-0 result code

    Other than the repository being setup there are no side effects (the
    operation happens in a subshell).  Note that the setup `pre-commit` script
    will look for the basename of TG_TEST_FULL_PATH in PATH so the dirname of
    TG_TEST_FULL_PATH must be in the PATH ahead of any other possible location
    in order for the hook to actually run the TG_TEST_FULL_PATH version of
    TopGit.

    Normally this will always be guaranteed as the TG_TEST_FULL_PATH being
    tested is located in the `bin-wrappers` directory which is always added to
    the front of the PATH by the testing framework when TG_TEST_FULL_PATH is
    using the `bin-wrappers` version.  If TG_TEST_FULL_PATH has been set to
    something else for some reason either use a different mechanism to set up
    the `pre-commit` hook or arrange for the dirname of TG_TEST_FULL_PATH to
    get added to the front of the PATH.

    The following will make sure the hook uses the correct version of TopGit:

        PATH="${TG_TEST_FULL_PATH%/*}:$PATH" && export PATH

    But make sure that's at the top-level of a test script and not in a subtest
    where its effects will be discared at the end of the subtest subshell.

- tg_test_v_getbases <varname> [<remotename>]

    Set the variable named by <varname> to the appropriate full ref prefix for
    local bases (if <remotename> is omitted or empty) or the specified remote
    given by <remotename>.

    The value of `tg_test_bases` influences the value (see the description of
    the `tg_test_bases` variable above for details).

- tg_test_v_getremote <varname> [<remotename>]

    Set the variable named by <varname> to "<remotename>" unless <remotename>
    is omitted or empty in which case use "$tg_test_remote" unless it's empty
    in which case die with a fatal error.
